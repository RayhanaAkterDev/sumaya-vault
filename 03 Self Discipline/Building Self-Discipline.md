### 1. Start Small
Pick one small daily task.  
Make your bed. Study for 30 minutes.  
Build habit through consistency — not big plans.

---

### 2. Block Distractions
Identify your top time-killer: YouTube? Instagram?  
Use screen time limiters — not because you're weak, but because you're focused.

---

### 3. Use a Reward System
People act for two reasons: punishment or reward.  
Finish a task → give yourself a small reward (coffee, walk, one episode).  
This keeps your motivation alive.

---

### 4. Don’t Try to Change Everything at Once
Start with one habit.  
Get consistent. Build momentum.  
Then move to the next.

---

### 5. Stay with Discomfort
Discipline means tolerating discomfort.  
Easy choices keep you stuck.  
Growth comes from doing the hard things.

---

### 6. Change Your Environment
No matter how motivated you are —  
if your environment is toxic, discipline won’t last.  
Stay around productivity → discipline becomes natural.
