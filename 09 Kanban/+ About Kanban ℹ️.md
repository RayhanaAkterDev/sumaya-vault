‚¨ÜÔ∏è:: [[09 Kanban|Kanban]]

The **Kanban** folder contains your **visual task boards** that help you track work progress using columns and cards.

It‚Äôs designed to give you a **clear, at-a-glance view** of what‚Äôs pending, in progress, or completed ‚Äî making task management intuitive and efficient.

### üß† Best used when:

- You want to **visualize workflow stages** clearly    
- You need to **limit work in progress** to focus better    
- You prefer **drag-and-drop task management**    
- You want to break down big projects into manageable pieces    

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Kanban boards work best when you **regularly update the cards and columns** to reflect current priorities.
