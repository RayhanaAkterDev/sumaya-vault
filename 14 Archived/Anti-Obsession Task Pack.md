##### What are you worried about?

To create a best obsidian interface, I'm not able to concentrate in my study and coding.

##### What’s looping in your mind?        

Creating the best obsidian interface. The worst thing is even if I create a interface, after sometime I don't like that anymore or something feels missing. In order to make a perfect obsidian interface, I've watched so many videos can't even count. So much time wasted, everyday. It becomes every nowadays habit. I keep aside everything, my study, coding, 
just everything, and every day i just waste time in creating a best obsidian interface.

##### What do you want to do instead?        

Of course, wanna focus on study and coding, nothing else.

Next allowed restructure: After Phase 4 (React Basics)

## ✅ 3. Anti-Loop Lockdown Strategy (For Your Obsession)

Now that your structure is set, you must **freeze** it for 3 months.

### 🛡️ Rules to Lock Your System:

1. ❌ You are **not allowed to restructure** folders/repos again until _Phase 4_ is complete (React).    
2. ✅ You can only **add inside existing folders** or create new folders _within the existing plan_.    
3. 🧠 Whenever you feel a loop starting, tell yourself:    
> "The structure is clean. The repo is CV-worthy. Now it's time to _fill it_."    
4. ✅ Make a `structure-locked.md` file in your root folder with:
> Structure finalized: 9 July 2025
> Next allowed restructure: After Phase 4 (React Basics)

---

**Use one central `projects/` folder** divided by topic/phase. ✅

|Repo Name|Includes|
|---|---|
|`frontend-bootcamp2.0`|✅ HTML, ✅ CSS, ✅ Responsive, ✅ Git, ✅ JS Basics + DOM|
|`js-advanced-bootcamp`|✅ ES6+, ✅ API, ✅ Async JS, etc.|
|`react-bootcamp`|✅ React Basics, ✅ Hooks, ✅ Routing, etc.|
|`php-laravel-bootcamp`|✅ PHP + Laravel Backend|
|`fullstack-projects`|✅ React + Laravel integration projects|
|`portfolio-site`|✅ Your own portfolio|

🟢 THIS IS GOOD. THIS IS ENOUGH.

You had already planned it well. You don’t need to change anything.  
No anxiety. Just **continue filling the repos.**

## ✅ Final Repo Lock (No More Renaming Needed)

**Repo**: `frontend-bootcamp2.0`

- `01-html/`    
- `02-css/`    
- `03-responsive/`    
- `04-git-github/`    
- `05-js-basics/`    
- `06-dom/`    
- `projects/` → Subfolders like `html-css-basic/`, `responsive/`  
    → Add README summaries where needed

---

| `js-advanced-bootcamp` |

- `01-es6-syntax/`    
- `02-async-js/`    
- `03-api-fetch/`    
- `projects/` → quote generator, search UI, etc.

---

| `react-bootcamp` |

- `01-jsx-basics/`    
- `02-components/`    
- `03-hooks/`    
- `projects/` → counter app, API app, form app

---

| `php-laravel-bootcamp` |

- `01-php-core/`    
- `02-laravel-setup/`    
- `03-routing-blade/`    
- `04-auth-crud/`    

---

| `fullstack-projects` |

- `hospital-management/`    
- `appointment-system/`  
    → Each project: full React + Laravel repo in subfolders

## 🧘 Final Rules (To Avoid the Loop)

1. ✅ Stick to these **repo names** — **do not rename them anymore**    
2. ✅ Freeze this structure for at least **3 phases**    
3. ✅ Add a `README.md` in each folder only after finishing the topic — not before    
4. ✅ Track progress using `progress.md` or simple commit messages    
5. ✅ You can now **focus 100% on filling these repos**, not designing them    

---

### 📌 What to Do _Today_:

You already have:

- ✅ Repo name (`frontend-bootcamp2.0`)    
- ✅ Folder structure plan    
- ✅ Topics scoped    

Now do this:

1. Finalize folders in that repo (`01-html`, `02-css`, etc.)    
2. Move any existing projects into `projects/html-css-basic/`    
3. Continue your 16 questions per day academic challenge    
4. After that, do **just 1 HTML+CSS mini project** tonight and commit

**You don’t need a new plan.**  
You just need to trust the one you already made — it was good. It **is** good.

You’re back in control now, Sumaya. Let’s move forward. No more changing. Just building. 🤍
