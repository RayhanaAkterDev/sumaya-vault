# 🚀 Phase 6: Production & Deployment

> **🎯 Goal:** Deploy **production-ready Laravel and React apps**, ensure **secure environment setup**, clean codebase, and implement **version control strategies** for professional project management.
> ⏳ **Suggested Duration:** 1 Jan 2026 → 31 Jan 2026 (1 month)

## ✅ Laravel App Deployment

### 🎯 Learning Topics
- Laravel deployment on shared hosting / Laravel Forge / VPS    
- `.env` configuration for production    
- File permission setup    
- Artisan commands: `config:cache`, `route:cache`, `migrate --force`    
- Managing queues and scheduled tasks (optional advanced)    

### 🧩 Mini Tasks
- Deploy a Laravel app to a shared hosting or VPS    
- Configure `.env` with secure DB and API credentials    
- Run Laravel migrations in production safely    
- Optimize with `php artisan optimize` and cache configs    

---

## ✅ React App Build & Deployment
### 🎯 Learning Topics
- Building a production version of React (`npm run build`)    
- Hosting React apps on Netlify / Vercel / GitHub Pages    
- Configuring environment variables (e.g., `REACT_APP_API_URL`)    
- Handling base URLs and routing with React Router in production    

### 🧩 Mini Tasks
- Deploy React frontend to Netlify or Vercel    
- Link it with live Laravel backend via API    
- Use `.env.production` for environment-specific config    

---

## ✅ Environment Variables & API Key Protection

### 🎯 Learning Topics
- Using `.env` files in Laravel and React securely    
- Avoid exposing sensitive data in frontend bundles    
- Git best practices to ignore `.env` and sensitive files    
- Laravel’s `config()` helper and caching env vars    

### 🧩 Mini Tasks
- Store API keys securely in `.env`    
- Set up `.gitignore` to exclude env files    
- Load environment variables dynamically (React: `process.env`)    

---

## ✅ Project Cleanup & Structure Polishing

### 🎯 Learning Topics
- Folder structure consistency (src/, components/, routes/, etc.)    
- Removing unused files, test data, and console logs    
- Comment cleanup and final documentation    
- Final `.env` separation for dev, staging, and production    

### 🧩 Mini Tasks
- Audit and clean the Laravel and React project folders    
- Remove unnecessary dependencies and test code    
- Add README with setup, features, deployment, and license info    

---

## ✅ Version Control Strategies

### 🎯 Learning Topics
- Git branching strategies (main/dev/feature/hotfix)    
- Semantic commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`)    
- Using GitHub/GitLab for version control    
- Tagging versions and creating releases    
- CI/CD basics (optional intro with GitHub Actions)    

### 🧩 Mini Tasks
- Finalize codebase and push to GitHub    
- Tag version (e.g., `v1.0.0`) and write release notes    
- Create a `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, and LICENSE file    

---

## ✅ Final Capstone — **Full Stack Portfolio Deployment**

### 🎯 Objectives
- A complete, polished, deployed **Laravel + React** project    
- Fully responsive frontend, protected backend APIs, real DB    
- Secure, clean, and version-controlled project    

### 🧩 Project Tasks
- Deploy backend API (Laravel) and frontend app (React)    
- Use production-ready environment with protected keys    
- Document setup in README and provide live demo links    
- Maintain code quality, folder structure, and git hygiene    
- Bonus: Add CI/CD deployment (GitHub → Netlify/Forge trigger)
