### Role of Computer Peripherals

Computer peripherals **extend a computer’s capabilities** and allow it to interact with users and the external environment. They assist the CPU and memory in handling input, output, and data storage.

The main roles of computer peripherals are:


1. **Input Devices**  
    These devices allow users to provide data and commands to the computer. They convert user actions (like typing or clicking) or external signals (like sound or images) into a digital format the computer can process.  
    **Examples and Roles:**  
	- **Keyboard:** Entering text, numbers, and commands.    
	- **Mouse:** Controlling the cursor and interacting with graphical interfaces.    
	- **Scanner:** Converting physical documents or images into digital files.    
	- **Microphone:** Capturing and recording audio input.    

2. **Output Devices**  
    These devices present processed data from the computer to the user in a perceptible form (visual, audio, or physical).  
    **Examples and Roles:**   
	- **Monitor:** Displaying text, images, and videos.    
	- **Printer:** Producing physical copies of documents and images.    
	- **Speakers/Headphones:** Providing audio output for music, video, and system sounds.    
	- **Projector:** Displaying visual output on a large screen or surface.    

3. **Storage and Communication Devices**  
    Some peripherals perform both input and output functions, mainly for data storage or network communication.  
    **Examples and Roles:**    
	- **External Hard Drive / USB Drive:** Storing and retrieving data.    
	- **Touchscreen:** Acts as both an input (touch) and output (display) device.    
	- **Modem / Router:** Facilitating data transmission and reception over a network or the internet.    
	- **Network Interface Card (NIC):** Sending and receiving data over a local network.    

**In summary**, computer peripherals bridge the gap between the internal processing of the computer and the external world, allowing users to interact with the system, exchange data, and extend its functionality beyond the CPU and memory.
