# Computer Peripherals and Interfacing

A **computer peripheral** is an auxiliary hardware device connected to a computer system to expand its functionality without being part of the core computing unit (CPU, memory, or motherboard). These devices enable interaction and data exchange between computers and the external environment. Peripherals are generally categorized based on data flow: **input devices** (e.g., keyboards and mice) send data to the computer, **output devices** (e.g., monitors and printers) receive and present data from the computer, and **storage devices** (e.g., hard drives and flash drives) function as both input and output devices.

##### Summary:

1. A **peripheral** is an external hardware device.    
2. It connects to the computer to **extend functionality**.    
3. Not part of the **main system (CPU, memory, motherboard)**.    
4. Enables **data exchange** with the outside world.    
5. Types: **Input, Output, and Storage** devices.
