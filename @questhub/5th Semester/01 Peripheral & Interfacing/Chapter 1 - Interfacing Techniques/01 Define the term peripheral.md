### **Computer Peripherals and Interfacing**

A **computer peripheral** is an auxiliary hardware device connected to a computer system to expand its functionality without being part of the core computing unit (CPU, memory, or motherboard). These devices enable interaction and data exchange between computers and the external environment. Peripherals are generally categorized based on data flow: **input devices** (e.g., keyboards and mice) send data to the computer, **output devices** (e.g., monitors and printers) receive and present data from the computer, and **storage devices** (e.g., hard drives and flash drives) function as both input and output devices.

**Interfacing** refers to the process and mechanisms, both hardware and software, through which peripheral devices are connected to and communicate with the CPU. It ensures proper transfer of data, control signals, and timing information between the computer and its external devices. Interfacing involves physical connections (ports and connectors, such as USB or HDMI) and communication protocols that define the rules for data transmission, synchronization, and error handling, effectively bridging the functional gap between the peripheral and the internal architecture of the computer.

**In summary, computer peripherals and interfacing together describe the external devices of a computer and the methods through which they interact with the CPU to perform the intended operations efficiently and reliably.**
