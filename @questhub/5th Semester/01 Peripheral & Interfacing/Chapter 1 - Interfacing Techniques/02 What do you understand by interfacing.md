**Interfacing** refers to the process and mechanisms, both hardware and software, through which peripheral devices are connected to and communicate with the CPU. It ensures proper transfer of data, control signals, and timing information between the computer and its external devices. Interfacing involves physical connections (ports and connectors, such as USB or HDMI) and communication protocols that define the rules for data transmission, synchronization, and error handling, effectively bridging the functional gap between the peripheral and the internal architecture of the computer.
