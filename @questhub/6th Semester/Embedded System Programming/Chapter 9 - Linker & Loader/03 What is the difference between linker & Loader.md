### Difference Between Linker and Loader

| Feature                | Linker                                                                                              | Loader                                                                                                              |

| **Definition**         | A software tool that combines multiple object files and libraries into a single executable.         | A part of the operating system that loads the executable into main memory for execution.                            |
| **Function**           | Resolves all symbolic references (like function calls and variables) between object files.          | Allocates memory for the program, sets up stack and heap, and prepares CPU to execute the program.                  |
| **Operation Time**     | Can work at **compile time** (static linking) or **runtime** (dynamic linking).                     | Works **only at runtime** when the program is executed.                                                             |
| **Input**              | Takes **object files** and required libraries as input.                                             | Takes the **executable file** produced by the linker as input.                                                      |
| **Output**             | Produces a **ready-to-run executable file**.                                                        | Loads the program into **main memory** and sets up execution environment.                                           |
| **Responsibilities**   | Combines object files, resolves external references, handles relocation, includes library routines. | Loads program into memory, resolves dynamic references, initializes data sections, starts execution at entry point. |
| **Memory Involvement** | Does not load the program into memory; works on files on disk.                                      | Loads the program into memory and sets up runtime environment (stack, heap, registers).                             |
| **Dependency**         | Depends on object files generated by a compiler or assembler.                                       | Depends on the executable file generated by the linker.                                                             |
| **Efficiency**         | Ensures program is complete and all references are correctly linked.                                | Ensures the program runs correctly in memory with proper resource allocation.                                       |
| **Example**            | Linking `main.o` and `math.o` to resolve `add(5, 10)` call.                                         | Loading `myprogram.exe` into memory and starting execution from `main()`.                                           |
