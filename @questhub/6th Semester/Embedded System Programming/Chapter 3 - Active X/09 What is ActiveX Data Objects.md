### Definition of ActiveX Data Objects (ADO)

**ActiveX Data Objects (ADO)** is a Microsoft technology that provides a **high-level interface for accessing and manipulating data** from various sources, such as databases, spreadsheets, or text files. It allows applications to interact with data in a uniform way, regardless of the underlying data source, making it easier for developers to retrieve, update, and manage information.

ADO is built on **COM (Component Object Model)**, which allows it to be used in multiple programming environments like Visual Basic, VBScript, and C++.

### Key Features of ADO

1. **Uniform Data Access**  
    ADO allows applications to access different types of data sources using the same interface, so developers do not need to worry about the specifics of each database.
    
2. **Simplified Programming**  
    ADO provides objects such as `Connection`, `Command`, `Recordset`, and `Field` to handle common database operations like querying, updating, and navigating records efficiently.
    
3. **Integration with Microsoft Technologies**  
    ADO works seamlessly with SQL Server, Access, Excel, and other data sources. It also integrates with Active Server Pages (ASP) for web-based applications.
    
4. **Flexible Data Manipulation**  
    ADO allows developers to retrieve data, modify it, and update the original data source in a structured and controlled way.
