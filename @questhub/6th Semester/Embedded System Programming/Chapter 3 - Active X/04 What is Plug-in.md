### Definition of Plug-in

> NOTE: _see exam kit page no. 316_

A **Plug-in** is a software component or module that adds specific features or functionalities to an existing computer program or application without altering the core program. Plug-ins extend the capabilities of the host application, allowing users to customize software according to their needs.

For example, web browsers like Chrome or Firefox use plug-ins to display videos, PDFs, or play games, while media players like VLC use plug-ins to support additional audio or video formats.

### Key Characteristics of Plug-ins

1. **Extends Functionality**  
    Plug-ins provide extra features to the main application, such as adding a new tool in an image editor or supporting additional media formats in a player.
    
2. **Independent Modules**  
    They are separate from the main software, meaning the core program can function without them, and plug-ins can be added or removed as needed.
    
3. **Easy to Install and Remove**  
    Users can easily install or uninstall plug-ins without modifying the main program.
    
4. **Customizable and Flexible**  
    Plug-ins allow users or developers to customize the software according to specific requirements, making the application more versatile.
    
5. **Interoperable**  
    They are designed to work within a specific host application and rely on the hostâ€™s API or interface for integration.
