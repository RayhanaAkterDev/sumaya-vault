### Definition of ActiveX

**ActiveX** is a software framework developed by Microsoft that allows different software components to interact and share information within the Windows environment. It is based on the **Component Object Model (COM)** and is widely used for embedding objects like videos, documents, and interactive programs into applications or web browsers.

ActiveX technology helps developers create **reusable software components** that can work across various applications, such as Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office, and Windows-based programs.

### Characteristics of ActiveX Control

1. **Reusable Components**  
    ActiveX Controls are designed to be self-contained, so they can be used in multiple applications without rewriting the code. For example, a calendar control created once can be embedded in Word, Excel, or custom applications.
    
2. **Interoperability**  
    They can work seamlessly across different Microsoft applications. This means a single ActiveX Control can interact with multiple programs, making development faster and consistent.
    
3. **Event-Driven**  
    ActiveX Controls respond to user actions such as clicks, data entry, or mouse movements. This allows applications to provide interactive features, like a play button in a media player or a data grid in a form.
    
4. **Binary Standard**  
    These controls are compiled into binary files, usually with a `.ocx` extension. This makes them fast to load and execute and ensures that the code behaves consistently across systems.
    
5. **Security Consideration**  
    Since ActiveX Controls can execute code on the client machine, they pose a potential security risk. Proper validation and trusted sources are essential to prevent malware or unauthorized actions.

### Characteristics of ActiveX Components

1. **Based on COM (Component Object Model)**  
    ActiveX Components follow the COM standard, which allows them to interact with other COM objects and integrate smoothly into the Windows environment.
    
2. **Language Independent**  
    They can be developed using different programming languages such as C++, Visual Basic, or Delphi, as long as they follow COM rules. This makes them versatile for developers with different skill sets.
    
3. **Reusable and Distributed**  
    ActiveX Components can be reused in multiple applications and distributed over networks. This allows centralized maintenance and consistent functionality across different programs.
    
4. **Encapsulation**  
    They encapsulate their internal logic and provide well-defined interfaces to applications. This means the user of the component does not need to know its internal workings to use its functionality.
    
5. **Scalability**  
    These components are suitable for large-scale applications, such as client-server systems, where multiple programs share the same component to provide consistent services.
