### Definition of API Testing

**API testing** is a type of software testing that focuses on verifying that **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** function correctly. Unlike testing the user interface, API testing evaluates the **business logic, data responses, and functionality** of APIs by sending requests and analyzing responses. It ensures that APIs return the expected results, handle errors properly, and maintain security, performance, and reliability.

API testing is important because APIs often serve as the backbone of modern applications, connecting different software components, services, and systems. By testing APIs, developers and testers can detect issues early in the development process, reduce bugs, and ensure that integrated systems work smoothly.

**Example:**  
Testing a payment API might involve sending a request to process a transaction and checking if the API correctly returns success, failure, or error messages under various conditions. Similarly, a weather API can be tested to verify that it returns accurate temperature and forecast data for a given location.
