## Embedded system

An embedded system is a microcontroller- or microprocessor-based computer hardware system designed to perform a dedicated function, either as an independent system or as part of a larger system. At its core is an integrated circuit responsible for carrying out computation, often in real-time. The complexity of an embedded system can vary significantly depending on the task it is designed to perform.

Embedded system consists of three components. They are —

1. Hardware,
2. Application software, &
3. RTOS (Real-time Operating System) - defines the way system works. It sets the rules during the execution of application system.

## Basic Components of Embedded System

1. **Processor** – acts as the brain, executes instructions and controls the system.    
2. **Memory** – stores program (firmware) and data (ROM, RAM, Flash, etc.).    
3. **Input/output Devices** – sensors, actuators, displays, communication ports.    
4. **Software (Firmware)** – the set of instructions that makes the hardware perform the dedicated task.
