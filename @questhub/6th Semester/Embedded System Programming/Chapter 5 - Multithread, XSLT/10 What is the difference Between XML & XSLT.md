## Difference Between XML & XSLT

**XML (Extensible Markup Language)** is a markup language used to **store and transport data in a structured format**. It focuses on **what the data is**, not how it should be displayed.

**XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations)** is a language used to **transform XML data into different formats**, such as HTML, plain text, or another XML structure. It focuses on **how the data is presented or reformatted**.

|Feature|XML|XSLT|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|Markup language to store and structure data|Transformation language to manipulate XML data|
|**Primary Purpose**|Represents the structure, content, and hierarchy of data|Converts XML data into another format for display or processing|
|**Functionality**|Provides a standardized way to describe data|Applies rules and templates to modify or format XML data|
|**Output**|Raw, structured XML data|HTML, plain text, another XML document, or other formats|
|**Dependency**|Independent, can exist and be used alone|Requires an XML document as input to transform|
|**Use Case**|Data exchange between different systems or applications|Dynamic presentation of XML data, such as displaying tables or reports|
|**Processing**|No processing is done; just data representation|Processes XML data based on templates and conditions|
|**Presentation Control**|Cannot control appearance|Controls formatting, styling, and output structure|
|**Extensibility**|Can define custom tags and attributes|Can handle complex transformations including sorting, filtering, and conditional logic|
