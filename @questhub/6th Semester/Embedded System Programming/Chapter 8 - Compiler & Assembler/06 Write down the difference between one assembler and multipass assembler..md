## Difference Between One-Pass and Multi-Pass Assembler

| **Feature**                    | **One-Pass Assembler**                                                          | **Multi-Pass Assembler**                                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Number of Passes**           | Scans the source program only once to translate instructions into machine code. | Scans the source program multiple times (usually two or more) to complete translation.                 |
| **Forward Reference Handling** | Cannot easily handle forward references (labels used before being defined).     | Can handle forward references effectively because later passes resolve undefined symbols.              |
| **Speed**                      | Faster, as it reads the program only once.                                      | Slower due to multiple passes over the source code.                                                    |
| **Memory Usage**               | Requires less memory since it processes instructions immediately.               | Requires more memory to store intermediate tables and code during multiple passes.                     |
| **Complexity**                 | Simple in design, easier to implement.                                          | More complex because it needs to manage symbol tables, addresses, and intermediate code across passes. |
| **Optimization**               | Limited ability to optimize code.                                               | Can perform optimizations, as it has complete information about the program in later passes.           |
| **Error Detection**            | Detects only immediate or simple errors during translation.                     | Can detect complex errors and inconsistencies because it reviews the program multiple times.           |
| **Program Size Handling**      | Suitable for small programs with minimal forward references.                    | Suitable for large programs with many labels, forward references, and complex instructions.            |
| **Example Use**                | Small, simple programs where forward references are minimal.                    | Large programs with many forward references or requiring optimization.                                 |
