### Kernel Log Level String

In Linux, the **kernel log level string** is used to define the importance or severity of messages generated by the kernel. Since the kernel continuously produces messages about system events, drivers, and errors, log levels help categorize them so that administrators and developers can easily identify critical issues and filter less important information. Each log level has a predefined meaning, ranging from emergency conditions to simple debugging details.

### Main Kernel Log Levels

1. **KERN_EMERG** â€“ Used for emergency messages when the system is unusable, such as hardware failure or a kernel panic.
    
2. **KERN_ALERT** â€“ Signals conditions that need immediate attention, like serious hardware or software errors that must be fixed right away.
    
3. **KERN_CRIT** â€“ Critical errors that affect important system functions, such as major device or memory failures.
    
4. **KERN_ERR** â€“ Standard error messages that indicate problems with devices, drivers, or subsystems but are not immediately fatal.
    
5. **KERN_WARNING** â€“ Warnings about potential issues that may not cause immediate damage but need monitoring.
    
6. **KERN_NOTICE** â€“ Informational messages about normal but significant events in the system.
    
7. **KERN_INFO** â€“ General system information, such as successful hardware detection or configuration details.
    
8. **KERN_DEBUG** â€“ Debugging messages used by developers to trace kernel behavior during testing.

âœ… **Example:**  
When a device driver fails to load, the kernel may generate a **KERN_ERR** message, but if the system crashes due to a fatal error, it would log a **KERN_EMERG** message. This classification helps administrators quickly focus on the most urgent problems.
