# Kernel

The **kernel** is the fundamental core of an operating system responsible for managing communication between hardware and software. It acts as the mediator that ensures programs and applications can use system resources like the CPU, memory, storage, and input/output devices efficiently and securely. The kernel handles critical functions such as process scheduling, memory management, device control, and file system organization. By controlling how resources are allocated and shared, it prevents conflicts and ensures stability in the system.

For example, when a user opens a web browser, the kernel allocates CPU time for execution, manages memory usage, and controls input/output devices like the keyboard, mouse, and display. Without the kernel, applications would not be able to interact with the underlying hardware, making it the most essential part of any operating system.
