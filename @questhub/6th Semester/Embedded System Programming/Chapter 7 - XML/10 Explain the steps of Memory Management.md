## Steps of Memory Management

Memory management is the process of efficiently handling a computerâ€™s memory resources to ensure smooth program execution. The operating system (OS) plays a vital role in allocating, tracking, and freeing memory for different processes.

### Main Steps of Memory Management

1. **Memory Allocation**  
    The OS assigns memory space to processes when they are loaded into the system. This can be **static allocation** (fixed during compile time) or **dynamic allocation** (assigned at runtime). Proper allocation prevents memory wastage and ensures all processes get required space.
    
2. **Memory Protection**  
    Each process must access only its allocated memory. Protection mechanisms prevent one process from reading or modifying another processâ€™s memory. This ensures system stability, security, and error prevention.
    
3. **Memory Mapping**  
    The OS maintains a mapping between logical (virtual) addresses used by programs and physical addresses in RAM. This mapping allows processes to work independently of actual memory size and location. Techniques like **paging** and **segmentation** are used here.
    
4. **Memory Swapping (or Management of Free Space)**  
    When physical memory is full, the OS may temporarily transfer inactive processes or data to secondary storage (like a hard disk). This process, called **swapping**, helps run multiple processes efficiently even with limited RAM.
    
5. **Garbage Collection / Memory Reclamation**  
    Unused or freed memory blocks are reclaimed by the OS and returned to the pool of free memory. This step ensures memory is available for future processes and avoids memory leaks.
    
6. **Deallocation**  
    Once a process completes execution, its allocated memory is released. Proper deallocation prevents fragmentation and improves memory utilization for upcoming processes.

### Example

Suppose a text editor program is opened:

- The OS allocates memory to load the program.    
- Protection ensures other programs cannot overwrite its space.    
- Mapping translates virtual addresses into physical ones for smooth execution.    
- If RAM is low, some inactive data may be swapped to disk.    
- When the editor is closed, memory is deallocated and made available to other processes.
