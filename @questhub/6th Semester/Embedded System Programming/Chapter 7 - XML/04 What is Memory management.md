### Memory Management in Embedded Systems

Memory management in embedded systems is the process of organizing, allocating, and optimizing memory usage for programs, data, and input/output operations, ensuring that the system functions correctly within strict memory constraints. Unlike general-purpose computers, embedded systems have fixed and small memory sizes, so all memory resources must be carefully managed. Program instructions are usually stored in ROM or Flash, runtime variables in RAM, and function calls use the stack. In some cases, dynamic memory allocation is avoided to prevent fragmentation, ensuring deterministic and predictable behavior, which is crucial for real-time applications.

Effective memory management also involves protecting memory from corruption, minimizing wastage, and optimizing usage so multiple processes or tasks can execute smoothly. For example, in a microcontroller-based temperature monitoring system, program instructions are stored in Flash and sensor readings in RAM. Efficient handling of these resources prevents crashes, memory leaks, and timing issues, enabling embedded devices to perform reliably even with stringent memory constraints.
