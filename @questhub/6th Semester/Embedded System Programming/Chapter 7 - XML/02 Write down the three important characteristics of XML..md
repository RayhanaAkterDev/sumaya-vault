### Three Important Characteristics of XML

1. **Extensible:**  
    XML allows users to create their own custom tags to describe data according to their needs. This flexibility makes it suitable for different applications, such as defining `<book>` and `<author>` in a library system or `<student>` and `<grade>` in a student database.
    
2. **Structured:**  
    XML organizes data hierarchically in a tree-like structure with elements and sub-elements. This structure makes data easy to store, read, and process. For example, a `<library>` element can contain multiple `<book>` elements, each with `<title>` and `<author>` sub-elements.
    
3. **Self-Descriptive:**  
    Each piece of data in XML is enclosed within descriptive tags, making the meaning of the data clear. For example, `<price>29.99</price>` clearly shows that 29.99 is the price, which helps both humans and programs understand the data easily.
