### Difference Between XML and HTML

| Feature                  | XML (Extensible Markup Language)                                                      | HTML (HyperText Markup Language)                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**              | Designed to store, describe, and transport data                                       | Designed to display and format data on web pages                    |
| **Tag Definition**       | Users can create their own custom tags                                                | Uses predefined tags (like `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<a>`)                    |
| **Data vs Presentation** | Focuses on data content and structure                                                 | Focuses on how data is displayed in a browser                       |
| **Case Sensitivity**     | Tags are case-sensitive                                                               | Tags are generally not case-sensitive                               |
| **Structure**            | Strict hierarchical structure, must be well-formed                                    | More flexible, browsers can render even if some tags are missing    |
| **Self-Descriptive**     | Yes, tags describe the meaning of data                                                | No, tags define appearance rather than meaning                      |
| **Error Handling**       | Parsing fails if XML is not well-formed                                               | Browsers try to render HTML even if it has errors                   |
| **Use Case**             | Data exchange between systems, configuration files, web services                      | Web page design, content formatting, and layout                     |
