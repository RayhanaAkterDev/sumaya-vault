### **How Database is Connected to a Web Application**

Connecting a database to a web application allows the application to **store, retrieve, update, and manipulate data dynamically**, enabling features like user accounts, transactions, and content management. This connection is achieved using **server-side programming** and database connectivity technologies.

### **Steps to Connect a Database to a Web Application**

1. **Select the Database System:**  
    First, choose a database that suits the applicationâ€™s requirements. Options include relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, or non-relational databases like MongoDB. The choice depends on the type of data, scalability needs, and performance expectations.
    
2. **Configure the Database:**  
    Set up the database by creating tables, fields, and relationships according to the applicationâ€™s data model. Define constraints, primary keys, and indexes to maintain data integrity and optimize query performance.
    
3. **Establish a Database Connection:**  
    Use server-side scripting languages (like PHP, Node.js, Java, or ASP.NET) to establish a connection. This involves creating a **connection string** with the database host, port, username, password, and database name. Proper connection handling ensures smooth communication between the web server and the database.
    
4. **Send Queries to the Database:**  
    The web application sends SQL (or NoSQL) queries to the database to perform operations such as retrieving records, inserting new data, updating existing records, or deleting unwanted information.
    
5. **Process the Results:**  
    The database returns the query results to the server-side script. The application then processes this data, formats it appropriately (like converting it to HTML or JSON), and displays it dynamically on the user interface.
    
6. **Close the Database Connection:**  
    After completing the operations, the connection is closed to free server resources and maintain security. Efficient connection management is important for application performance, especially when multiple users access the system simultaneously.
    
7. **Implement Security and Error Handling:**  
    Protect the database from unauthorized access and attacks using authentication, input validation, prepared statements, and encryption. Additionally, implement error handling to manage query failures or connection issues without crashing the application.

### **Example:**

In an **online shopping application**, when a user searches for a product:

- The server-side script sends a query to the database to fetch products matching the search term.
- The database returns the results.    
- The script processes the data and dynamically generates the HTML page with the product list.
- The connection is closed, and the user sees the results instantly.
