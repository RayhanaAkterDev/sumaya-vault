### **Server**

A **server** is a computer system, device, or software program that **provides services, resources, or data to other computers (clients) over a network**. Servers are central to the client-server architecture, where clients request services and servers respond to those requests. They can host websites, manage databases, handle emails, store files, or run applications, depending on their type and configuration.

Servers are designed to handle **multiple client requests simultaneously**, provide high reliability, and ensure security. They can be **physical machines** dedicated to serving clients or **virtual servers** running on cloud platforms.

### **Key Features of a Server**

1. **Service Provider:**  
    Servers deliver services such as web hosting, file storage, email handling, and database management to clients on demand.
    
2. **Continuous Availability:**  
    Servers are designed to run continuously (24/7) to ensure clients can access resources at any time.
    
3. **Multi-Client Handling:**  
    A single server can serve multiple clients simultaneously, efficiently managing requests and resources.
    
4. **Resource Management:**  
    Servers manage hardware and software resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth to optimize performance.
    
5. **Security:**  
    Servers implement security measures like authentication, encryption, and access control to protect data and resources.
    
6. **Centralized Control:**  
    Servers act as a central hub, simplifying the management, backup, and maintenance of applications and data.

âœ… **Example:**  
A **web server** like Apache or IIS hosts websites and delivers HTML pages to usersâ€™ browsers when they request a webpage. Similarly, a **database server** like MySQL or SQL Server manages data storage and queries for applications.
