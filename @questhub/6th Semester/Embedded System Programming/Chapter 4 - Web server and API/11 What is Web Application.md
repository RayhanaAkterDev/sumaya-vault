### **Web Application**

A **Web Application** is a software program that runs on a web server and is accessed by users through a web browser over the Internet or an intranet. Unlike traditional desktop applications, web applications do not need to be installed on a userâ€™s device; they are platform-independent and can be used on any device with a compatible browser. Web applications combine server-side processing (to handle logic, database interaction, and user requests) with client-side technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to deliver interactive and dynamic user experiences.

Web applications are widely used in e-commerce, online banking, social media, content management systems, and collaborative tools, providing users with real-time access to services and data from anywhere.

### **Key Features of Web Applications**

1. **Browser-Based Access:**  
    Users can access the application via a web browser without installing additional software.
    
2. **Platform Independence:**  
    Web applications can run on any device and operating system that supports a web browser.
    
3. **Client-Server Architecture:**  
    They follow a client-server model, where the browser sends requests to the server, which processes them and returns the response.
    
4. **Dynamic Content:**  
    Content can change based on user interactions, database queries, or session data.
    
5. **Database Integration:**  
    Web applications interact with databases to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in real-time.
    
6. **Interactivity and User Input:**  
    Users can perform actions like submitting forms, making purchases, or updating information, and receive immediate feedback.
    
7. **Security Features:**  
    Web applications implement authentication, authorization, encryption, and secure data handling to protect user information.
    
8. **Scalability:**  
    Web applications can handle multiple users simultaneously and scale as user demand increases.
