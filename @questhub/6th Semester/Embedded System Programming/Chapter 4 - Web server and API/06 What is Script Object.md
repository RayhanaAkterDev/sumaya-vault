### **Script Object**

A **Script Object** is a self-contained software component that contains scripts, functions, and procedures written in a scripting language (such as JavaScript, VBScript, or Python). It provides a structured way to encapsulate logic, automate tasks, and extend the functionality of applications. Script objects can expose properties, methods, and events that other programs or scripts can access, making them reusable and interactive. They are commonly used in environments like web development, application automation, and OLE/ActiveX-based systems, where they act as programmable building blocks for dynamic behavior.

### **Functions of a Script Object**

1. **Encapsulation of Code:**  
    Script objects group related scripts, variables, and functions together in one unit, making the code organized and reusable.
    
2. **Reusability:**  
    Once created, a script object can be reused across different parts of an application, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.
    
3. **Event Handling:**  
    They can respond to events (like button clicks, form submissions, or user interactions), providing dynamic and interactive behavior in applications.
    
4. **Integration with Applications:**  
    Script objects often interact with host applications or environments, enabling automation, customization, or extension of built-in features.
    
5. **Platform Independence:**  
    Since they are based on scripting languages, script objects can run across different platforms and environments with little or no modification.
