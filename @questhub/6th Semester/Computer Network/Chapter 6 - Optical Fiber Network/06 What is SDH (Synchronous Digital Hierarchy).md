# Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH)

**SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy)** is an international standard for **high-speed digital transmission over optical fiber networks**. It allows multiple digital bit streams to be **multiplexed, transported, and managed efficiently** in a synchronized manner. SDH provides **flexible, reliable, and scalable communication**, supporting data rates from tens of Mbps to several Gbps. It is widely used in backbone and metropolitan area networks to transport voice, data, and video traffic.

**Key Features:**

- Ensures precise **synchronization of all transmitted signals**.    
- Facilitates **easy network management and monitoring**.    
- Allows **rapid fault detection and recovery** in case of link or device failure.    
- Compatible with SONET, providing interoperability with North American networks.
- Supports multiple **network topologies** including point-to-point, ring, and mesh for high reliability.

**Example:**  
In a telecom backbone network, SDH enables simultaneous transmission of multiple voice calls, internet data, and video streams over the same optical fiber while maintaining synchronization and quality of service.
