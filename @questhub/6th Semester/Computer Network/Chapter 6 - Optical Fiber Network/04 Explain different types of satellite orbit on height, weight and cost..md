# Types of Satellite Orbits

Satellites orbit the Earth at different altitudes depending on their purpose, coverage, and cost. The three main types of satellite orbits are **Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO)**. Each orbit has distinct characteristics in terms of height, coverage area, latency, and cost.

**1. Low Earth Orbit (LEO):**  
LEO satellites orbit at an altitude of approximately 160 km to 2,000 km above the Earth. They cover a relatively small portion of the Earth at a time, which means multiple satellites are required for global coverage. These satellites are generally lighter, making them cheaper to launch individually. However, the overall system cost can be higher due to the large number of satellites needed. LEO satellites move quickly, completing one orbit in about 90‚Äì120 minutes, and are ideal for mobile communications, Earth observation, and low-latency internet services like Starlink.

**2. Medium Earth Orbit (MEO):**  
MEO satellites orbit at altitudes ranging from 2,000 km to 35,786 km. They cover a larger portion of the Earth than LEO satellites, so fewer satellites are required for global coverage. MEO satellites are heavier and more expensive than LEO satellites due to the increased launch energy and stronger structures needed for higher altitudes. Their orbit takes several hours, and they are commonly used for navigation systems such as GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo, providing a balance between coverage and latency.

**3. Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO):**  
GEO satellites orbit at an altitude of approximately 35,786 km above the equator. Each GEO satellite can cover almost one-third of the Earth‚Äôs surface, meaning that only three satellites are needed for near-global coverage. These satellites are very heavy because they require large antennas, powerful transmitters, and robust structures to maintain stability at high altitude. They are also expensive due to complex engineering and high launch energy requirements. GEO satellites appear stationary relative to the Earth, making them ideal for television broadcasting, weather monitoring, and long-distance communications. However, they have high latency of about 0.25 seconds one-way due to the long distance.

**Example:**  
LEO satellites like Iridium or Starlink provide low-latency internet worldwide. MEO satellites like GPS satellites provide precise positioning services. GEO satellites like those used for Direct-to-Home TV provide constant coverage over large regions.
