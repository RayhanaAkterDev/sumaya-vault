A **switching network** is a core part of a communication system that connects multiple devices or nodes, allowing information to be transmitted efficiently from a source to a destination. It acts as the intermediate path that establishes a connection between the sender and the receiver.

Switching networks consist of switchesâ€”either electronic or mechanicalâ€”that manage the routing of data, voice, or video signals between nodes. Their main purpose is to determine the optimal path for data to travel from the source to the destination, enabling multiple users to share the same network resources efficiently and reliably.

**Components of a Switching Network:**

- **Input lines:** Points where data enters the network.    
- **Switching elements:** Core units that connect inputs to outputs.    
- **Output lines:** Points where data exits the network toward its destination.

**Types of Switching Networks:**

1. **Circuit Switching:** A dedicated communication path is set up between sender and receiver for the whole communication. It allows real-time transmission (e.g., telephone networks) but is less efficient for irregular or bursty data.
    
2. **Packet Switching:** Data is broken into packets and sent independently through the network. Paths are chosen dynamically, making it efficient for irregular data (e.g., the Internet).
    
3. **Message Switching:** Entire messages are sent from source to destination in a store-and-forward way, meaning messages are temporarily stored at intermediate nodes. No dedicated path is needed, but it can be slower.
