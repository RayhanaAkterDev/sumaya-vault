### **Why CSMA/CD is Not Applicable for Wireless LAN**

In wired Ethernet networks, CSMA/CD works effectively to detect and handle collisions. However, in wireless LANs, the same method cannot be applied due to the unique characteristics of wireless communication.

1. **Collision Detection Problem** â€“ In wireless networks, a station cannot reliably detect collisions while transmitting because the **signal strength of its own transmission is much stronger** than signals from other stations, making it difficult to sense overlapping transmissions.
    
2. **Hidden Node Problem** â€“ Two stations may be out of each otherâ€™s range but still communicate with the same access point. If both transmit simultaneously, a collision occurs at the access point, but the stations cannot detect it.
    
3. **Exposed Node Problem** â€“ A station may sense another nearby transmission and unnecessarily defer its own transmission, even though sending would not cause a collision. This reduces efficiency.
    
4. **Signal Attenuation and Interference** â€“ Wireless signals are affected by **attenuation, fading, and interference** from obstacles or other devices. These factors make it difficult to distinguish between a collision and natural signal loss.
    
5. **No Dedicated Medium** â€“ Unlike wired LANs, wireless networks **share a broadcast medium without physical isolation**, so stations cannot sense all ongoing transmissions effectively.
    
6. **Alternative Approach Needed** â€“ Due to these challenges, wireless LANs use **CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)**, which **prevents collisions before they occur** instead of detecting them after transmission.
