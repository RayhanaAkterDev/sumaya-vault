## Comparison Between IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.16

|Feature|IEEE 802.11 (WLAN)|IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX)|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Provides **wireless local area network (WLAN)** connectivity within small areas like homes, offices, and campuses.|Provides **wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN)** connectivity over larger areas, like cities or suburbs.|
|**Coverage Range**|Short range: typically **30â€“100 meters indoors**, up to **300 meters outdoors**.|Long range: typically **up to 50 km**, depending on line-of-sight and frequency.|
|**Data Rate**|Moderate: IEEE 802.11ac can reach **up to 1 Gbps**, but typical practical rates are lower.|Higher: IEEE 802.16e can provide **up to 70 Mbps** per subscriber under ideal conditions.|
|**Frequency Band**|Operates in **2.4 GHz and 5 GHz** unlicensed bands.|Operates in **licensed bands** (2â€“66 GHz) depending on deployment.|
|**Topology**|Supports **infrastructure mode** (via access points) and **ad hoc mode** (peer-to-peer).|Supports **point-to-multipoint topology**, connecting multiple subscriber stations to a base station.|
|**Mobility Support**|Limited mobility; mainly designed for stationary or low-mobility users.|Designed for **high mobility**, supporting handovers and roaming over wide areas.|
|**MAC Layer Protocol**|Uses **CSMA/CA** (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) for medium access.|Uses **TDMA/OFDM** scheduling for efficient medium access and QoS support.|
|**Applications**|Indoor WLAN, office networks, home Wi-Fi, small campus networks.|Broadband wireless access for urban and rural areas, last-mile connectivity, mobile internet.|
