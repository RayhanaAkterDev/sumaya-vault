### **Functions of Hub and Switch**

1. **Hub** â€“ A hub is a basic networking device that **connects multiple devices** in a LAN, allowing them to communicate. Its main function is to **receive data from one device and broadcast it to all other connected devices**, regardless of the intended destination. Hubs operate at the **physical layer (Layer 1)** of the OSI model and **do not filter, manage, or prioritize traffic**. Because they broadcast data to all ports, hubs can lead to **network congestion, collisions, and lower overall efficiency**. Hubs are simple, inexpensive, and mainly used in **small, legacy, or less demanding networks** where high performance is not critical.

2. **Switch** â€“ A switch is a more intelligent networking device that **connects multiple devices** in a LAN and **forwards data only to the intended recipient device**. It operates at the **data link layer (Layer 2)** and uses **MAC addresses** to determine the correct destination for each data frame. By doing this, switches **reduce collisions and improve network efficiency**, as each port effectively forms its own collision domain. Many modern switches also support advanced features such as **VLANs (Virtual LANs), Quality of Service (QoS), port security, and even Layer 3 routing**, making them suitable for **larger, complex, and high-performance networks**. Switches are widely used in modern LANs to ensure **fast, secure, and efficient communication** between devices.
