- **WiMAX (IEEE 802.16)** â€“ WiMAX, based on the **IEEE 802.16 standard**, is a **wireless broadband technology** that provides **high-speed internet access over long distances**. It supports both **fixed and mobile users**, with coverage up to **50 km** in ideal conditions. WiMAX can deliver **high data rates** suitable for **last-mile connectivity, metropolitan area networks (MANs), and mobile broadband services**. It uses technologies like **OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)** for efficient spectrum use and supports **QoS (Quality of Service)** for different types of traffic, such as voice, video, and data.

- **Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)** â€“ Wi-Fi is a **wireless LAN technology** based on the **IEEE 802.11 standard** that allows devices to **connect and communicate without cables** over short distances. It is widely used in **homes, offices, schools, and public hotspots**. Wi-Fi operates in **unlicensed frequency bands** such as 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, and newer versions like 802.11ac/ax provide **higher speeds and better reliability**. It enables **mobile devices, laptops, and IoT devices** to access the internet and local networks conveniently.

- **Communication Medium** â€“ A communication medium is the **physical or logical path** through which data is transmitted between devices in a network. It can be **wired**, such as **twisted pair cables, coaxial cables, or optical fibers**, or **wireless**, such as **radio waves, microwaves, or infrared signals**. The choice of medium affects **transmission speed, distance, reliability, and susceptibility to interference**. The medium is essential for establishing **effective and efficient communication** between devices in any network.
