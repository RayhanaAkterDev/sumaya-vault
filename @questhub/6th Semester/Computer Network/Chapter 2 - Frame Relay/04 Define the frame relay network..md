## What is Frame Relay Network?

A Frame Relay network is a **wide area network (WAN) built using Frame Relay technology**. It connects multiple sites, such as branch offices of an organization, over a shared network infrastructure. The network uses **virtual circuits** to establish logical connections between sites, eliminating the need for dedicated physical lines. This allows **flexible, scalable, and cost-effective communication**. A Frame Relay network provides fast data transfer, efficient bandwidth usage, and supports multiple simultaneous connections, making it suitable for interconnecting LANs, remote database access, and other enterprise applications.
