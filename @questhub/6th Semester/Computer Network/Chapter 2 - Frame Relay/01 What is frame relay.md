## What is Frame Relay?

> Note: _Checkout exam kit page no. 164_

Frame Relay is a **high-speed, packet-switched data communication technology** used for transmitting digital data over wide area networks (WANs). It sends data in small, variable-length units called **frames**, which reduces overhead and increases transmission efficiency. Frame Relay is designed to be **fast, cost-effective, and reliable** for connecting local area networks (LANs) over long distances. It uses **virtual circuits**, which can be permanent (PVC) or switched (SVC), to route data between devices. Frame Relay is best suited for **bursty data traffic** and assumes that modern networks have low error rates, so it performs minimal error checking to maintain speed.
