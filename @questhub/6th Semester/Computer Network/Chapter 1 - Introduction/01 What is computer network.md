## What is computer network?

A **computer network** is a system of two or more interconnected computers and computing devices that are linked through communication channels—such as cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared beams—to enable communication, data exchange, and resource sharing (e.g., files, printers, or internet access) among users. Networks can use wired (like Ethernet) or wireless (like Wi-Fi) technologies to function effectively.
