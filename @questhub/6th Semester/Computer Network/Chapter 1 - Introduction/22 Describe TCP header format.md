## TCP Header Format

The **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** header is a fixed-format structure used to manage reliable data transmission between two devices. It contains multiple fields that provide control information for establishing connections, segmenting data, ensuring delivery, and managing flow and errors. The standard TCP header is **20 bytes (160 bits)** long without optional fields and can extend up to **60 bytes** if options are included.

```

- **Source Port and Destination Port:** These are 16-bit fields that represent the communication endpoints of sending and receiving devices. They identify which application process **is sending the data and which one should receive it**.
    
- **Sequence Number:** This is a 32-bit field used by the sender to mark the ordering of a group of messages. It indicates the byte number of the first data byte in the segment and helps both sender and receiver maintain correct data order.
    
- **Acknowledgment Number:** This 32-bit field is used by the receiver to confirm receipt of data. It communicates the next byte sequence number that the receiver expects, ensuring reliable delivery.
    
- **Data Offset:** This 4-bit field stores the total size of the TCP header in multiples of four bytes. It tells where the actual data begins. A minimum header without options has an offset of 5 (20 bytes), while the maximum with options can reach 15 (60 bytes).
    
- **Reserved Field:** This 6-bit space is reserved for future use and is always set to zero. It ensures alignment and processing efficiency of TCP headers.
    
- **Control Flags:** TCP uses six standard control flags (URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, FIN) and three extended ones to manage the flow of communication. These flags handle connection establishment, data delivery, and connection termination.
    
- **Window Size:** This 16-bit field defines how many bytes a sender is willing to receive before acknowledgment. It is essential for flow control. If too small, transfer becomes slow; if too large, it may overwhelm the receiver or saturate the network. Modern TCP uses dynamic window scaling to adjust values.
    
- **Checksum:** This 16-bit field is generated by the sender to check for errors in both the header and data. It allows the receiver to detect corrupted or tampered messages using mathematical verification.
    
- **Urgent Pointer:** This 16-bit field is used when the URG flag is set. It indicates the end of urgent data that requires priority processing. In most cases, it is set to zero and ignored, but it can be used for special control messages.
    
- **Options and Padding:** This variable-length field (0–40 bytes) provides extended features such as maximum segment size (MSS), window scaling, and timestamps, while extra zero bits (padding) are added to make the total header length a multiple of 32 bits, ensuring proper alignment and flexibility for advanced TCP functions.
