### VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)

VoIP is a communication technology that allows the transmission of **voice, video, and multimedia sessions over the Internet** or other IP-based networks instead of traditional telephone lines. It converts analog voice signals into digital data packets, transmits them over the network, and reconverts them into voice at the receiving end.
