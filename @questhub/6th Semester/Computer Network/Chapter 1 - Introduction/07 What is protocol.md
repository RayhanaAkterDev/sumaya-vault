## Definition of Protocol

A **protocol** is a formal set of rules and conventions that govern how data is transmitted, received, and interpreted between devices in a communication network. It defines the syntax, semantics, and timing of the communication to ensure that devices from different manufacturers can communicate effectively and reliably. Protocols specify how data is formatted, how errors are detected and corrected, and how connections are established and terminated.

Examples of common protocols include HTTP (for web communication), TCP/IP (for internet data transfer), and FTP (for file transfer).
