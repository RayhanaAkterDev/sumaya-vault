# Firewall

A **firewall** is a network security system, either as software or hardware, designed to **monitor, filter, and control network traffic** between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet. It enforces a set of predefined security rules to allow or block traffic, protecting computers and networks from unauthorized access, cyberattacks, viruses, and data breaches. Firewalls act as a barrier, ensuring that sensitive information within a network remains safe while permitting legitimate communication, and they can also log traffic for auditing and security analysis.

**Example:**  
A corporate firewall blocks external users from accessing internal servers directly while allowing authorized employees to connect securely, and monitors outgoing traffic to detect potential security breaches.

**Key Points:**

1. Filters traffic based on IP addresses, ports, protocols, and content.    
2. Prevents unauthorized access, malware, and hacking attempts.    
3. Supports **different types**: packet-filtering firewall, stateful inspection firewall, and proxy firewall.    
4. Maintains network security and ensures safe communication between internal and external networks.    
5. Often integrated with intrusion detection systems (IDS) and other advanced security tools.
