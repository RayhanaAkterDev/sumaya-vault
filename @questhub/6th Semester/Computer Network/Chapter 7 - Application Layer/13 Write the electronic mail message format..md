# Electronic Mail (Email) Message Format

An **electronic mail message** is structured in a standard format to ensure proper delivery, readability, and interpretation by email systems. It generally consists of **two main sections**: the **header** and the **body**.

---

## 1. Header

The header contains information needed for routing, identification, and processing of the email. Common fields include:

1. **From:** The senderâ€™s email address.    
2. **To:** The recipientâ€™s email address.    
3. **Cc (Carbon Copy):** Email addresses of secondary recipients who will receive a copy.
4. **Bcc (Blind Carbon Copy):** Email addresses of recipients hidden from others.    
5. **Date:** The date and time when the email was sent.    
6. **Subject:** A brief summary of the email content.    
7. **Message-ID:** A unique identifier assigned to the email.    
8. **Reply-To:** Address where replies should be sent (optional).

## 2. Body

The body contains the actual message intended for the recipient. It may include:

1. **Text content:** The main written message.    
2. **Attachments:** Files, images, or documents sent along with the email.    
3. **Formatting:** Optional formatting like fonts, colors, or HTML content.
