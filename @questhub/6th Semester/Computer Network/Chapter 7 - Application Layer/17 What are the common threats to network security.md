# Common Threats to Network Security

Network security is essential to protect data and resources from unauthorized access, misuse, or attacks. Networks face various threats that can compromise **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of information. Understanding these threats is crucial to implement effective security measures.

## Common Network Security Threats

1. **Unauthorized Access**  
    Attackers or unauthorized users gain access to network resources or sensitive data without permission, potentially leading to data theft or misuse.  
    _Example:_ Hackers accessing a companyâ€™s internal database.
    
2. **Malware**  
    Malicious software such as viruses, worms, Trojans, or ransomware that can damage, steal, or encrypt data, and disrupt network operations.  
    _Example:_ A ransomware attack locking company files until a ransom is paid.
    
3. **Phishing Attacks**  
    Attackers trick users into revealing sensitive information like passwords or banking details through fake emails, websites, or messages.  
    _Example:_ A fake bank email asking a user to log in and steal credentials.
    
4. **Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**  
    Attacks that overload network resources, making services unavailable to legitimate users.  
    _Example:_ A website crashing due to massive bot traffic.
    
5. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**  
    An attacker secretly intercepts or alters communication between two parties without their knowledge.  
    _Example:_ Intercepting login credentials over an unsecured Wi-Fi network.
    
6. **Eavesdropping / Sniffing**  
    Unauthorized interception of network traffic to read sensitive data like emails, passwords, or financial information.  
    _Example:_ Capturing unencrypted login data over a public Wi-Fi network.
    
7. **SQL Injection and Other Application Attacks**  
    Exploiting vulnerabilities in networked applications to gain unauthorized access or manipulate data.  
    _Example:_ Entering malicious SQL commands on a website to access user data.
    
8. **Insider Threats**  
    Employees or internal users intentionally or accidentally compromise network security by leaking data or bypassing controls.  
    _Example:_ A disgruntled employee copying confidential files to external storage.
    
9. **Spoofing and Identity Theft**  
    Attackers impersonate trusted users or devices to gain unauthorized access or manipulate communication.  
    _Example:_ IP spoofing to bypass network authentication.
