# Stakeholder and Use Case

A **stakeholder** is any person, group, or organization that has an interest in the development, use, or outcome of a software system. This includes users, clients, developers, testers, project managers, and regulatory bodies — anyone who is affected by or can influence the system.

🟢 **Example:** A university student using the student portal, or an admin managing it, both are stakeholders.

A **use case** is a methodology used in system analysis to identify , clarify, and organize system requirements. The use case is made up of a set of possible sequences of interactions between systems and users in a particular environment and related to a particular goal.

In simple terms, a **use case** is a specific scenario that describes **how a user interacts with a system** to achieve a particular goal. It defines the steps or actions between a user (actor) and the system to complete a task.

**Every use case contains three essential elements**:

> 1. **Actor**: The **actor** is the person or system that interacts with the software to achieve a goal. It could be a user, admin, or another system. _Example:_ A student logging in to register for a course.

> 2. **System**: The **system** refers to the software or application that responds to the actor’s actions and performs the required tasks. It shows what the system does in response to the actor’s input. _Example:_ The course registration system that processes the student’s request.

>3. **Goal**: The **goal** is the final outcome the actor wants to achieve by interacting with the system. Each use case is centered around one specific goal. _Example:_ Successfully registering for a course.
