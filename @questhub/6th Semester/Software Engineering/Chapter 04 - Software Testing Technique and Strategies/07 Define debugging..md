**Debugging** is the process of identifying, analyzing, and removing errors or defects (also called **bugs**) from a computer program to ensure it works correctly according to its specifications. It involves locating the source of a problem in the code, understanding why it occurs, and modifying the program to fix it.

Debugging is an essential part of software development and maintenance, as it helps improve the **reliability, correctness, and performance** of the software. Common techniques include using **print statements, breakpoints, debuggers, and code reviews** to trace and fix errors systematically.

In short, debugging is **‚Äúfinding and fixing errors in a program‚Äù** to make it function as intended.
