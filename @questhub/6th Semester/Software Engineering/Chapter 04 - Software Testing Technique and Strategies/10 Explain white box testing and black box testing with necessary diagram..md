### **1. White Box Testing**

White box testing, also called **structural or glass-box testing**, is a software testing technique in which the tester has **complete knowledge of the internal code, logic, and structure**. The main objectives are to **verify the correctness of the code, test all possible paths and conditions, detect logical and syntax errors, and ensure that every function works as intended**. It helps improve code quality and efficiency by identifying redundant or unreachable code early.

**Key Features:**

1. Requires **full understanding of the program’s internal logic** and structure.    
2. Focuses on **code coverage**, including statement, branch, and path coverage.    
3. Detects **logical errors, security vulnerabilities, and boundary cases**.    
4. Helps in **optimizing algorithms and removing redundant code**.    
5. Typically used in **unit testing and integration testing**.

**Advantages:**

1. Detects errors **early in the development cycle**, reducing cost of fixes.    
2. Improves **code quality, maintainability, and efficiency**.    
3. Ensures **all paths and conditions** in the program are tested.    
4. Helps developers **understand program flow better**.    
5. Can be combined with automation tools to **increase testing speed and coverage**.

### **2. Black Box Testing**

Black box testing, also known as **behavioral or functional testing**, is a testing technique where the tester **does not require knowledge of the internal code**. The objectives are to **validate software functionality against requirements, check input-output behavior, identify missing functionalities or errors, and ensure the system meets user expectations**. It tests the software purely from a user or external perspective.

**Key Features:**

1. No need to know the **internal code or logic**.    
2. Focuses on **functional requirements, user inputs, and expected outputs**.    
3. Can detect **functional errors, usability issues, performance bottlenecks, and security flaws**.    
4. Useful for **system, acceptance, and regression testing**.    
5. Can be applied **even if the internal code is incomplete**.    
6. Tests **end-to-end behavior** of the system to ensure compliance with specifications.    

**Advantages:**

1. Evaluates software **from the user’s perspective**, ensuring it meets requirements.    
2. Can **identify discrepancies between design specifications and implementation**.    
3. Easy to perform for testers **without programming knowledge**.    
4. Helps ensure **system reliability and user satisfaction**.    
5. Can be **combined with automated testing tools** to validate multiple scenarios quickly.    
6. Useful for **finding missing functionalities and unexpected behavior**.
