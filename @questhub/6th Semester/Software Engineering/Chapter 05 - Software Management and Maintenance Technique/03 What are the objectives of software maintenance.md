### Objectives of Software Maintenance

Software maintenance is crucial to ensure that a software system remains reliable, efficient, and relevant after it has been deployed. The objectives go beyond simply fixing errors; they also include improving functionality, adapting to changes, preventing future issues, and ensuring long-term usability.

1. **Correcting Defects:**  
    The primary objective is to identify and fix errors, bugs, or faults discovered after the software is in use. This ensures that the software continues to operate correctly and reliably. For example, fixing a calculation error in a hospital billing module.
    
2. **Improving Performance:**  
    Maintenance aims to enhance the software‚Äôs performance in terms of speed, responsiveness, and resource utilization. Optimizing code or improving database queries can make the software more efficient and user-friendly.
    
3. **Adapting to Changes in Environment:**  
    Software must be adapted to changes in hardware, operating systems, or regulations. This ensures that the software remains compatible and continues to function correctly in a changing technical environment.
    
4. **Enhancing Functionality:**  
    Maintenance allows adding new features or improving existing ones based on evolving user requirements. For example, introducing online appointment booking in a hospital management system to meet modern user needs.
    
5. **Preventing Future Problems:**  
    Preventive maintenance involves making proactive changes to reduce the risk of future errors, such as refactoring complex code, improving modularity, or updating documentation for easier understanding.
    
6. **Ensuring Reliability and Availability:**  
    Maintenance ensures the software remains reliable and available for users at all times. Regular updates and checks prevent system crashes and downtime, which is critical for systems like healthcare or banking.
    
7. **Extending Software Life:**  
    By continuously updating and improving the software, maintenance extends its useful life. Well-maintained software avoids obsolescence and remains relevant to users for a longer period.
    
8. **Meeting User Satisfaction:**  
    Maintaining software in response to user feedback ensures that it continues to meet user expectations, enhancing user satisfaction and trust in the system.
