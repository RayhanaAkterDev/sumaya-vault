### Types of Software Maintenance

Software maintenance involves modifying and updating software after its delivery to ensure it continues to operate correctly, adapts to changes, and meets user requirements. Maintenance can be categorized based on its purpose.

**The four types of software maintenance**

1. **Corrective Maintenance:**  
    Corrective maintenance focuses on fixing errors or defects in the software that are discovered after deployment. This includes coding mistakes, logic errors, or user-reported bugs. For example, fixing a bug in a hospital management system that miscalculates patient bills.
    
2. **Adaptive Maintenance:**  
    Adaptive maintenance involves modifying software to function correctly in a changed environment. This can include updates due to new operating systems, hardware changes, or regulatory requirements. For example, updating the software to be compatible with a new version of Windows.
    
3. **Perfective Maintenance:**  
    Perfective maintenance aims to enhance the performance, efficiency, or usability of software. It often involves adding new features or improving existing ones based on user feedback. For example, adding an online appointment booking feature in a hospital management system.
    
4. **Preventive Maintenance:**  
    Preventive maintenance focuses on preventing future problems by improving code quality, optimizing performance, or updating documentation. For example, refactoring complex code modules to reduce the likelihood of future bugs.
