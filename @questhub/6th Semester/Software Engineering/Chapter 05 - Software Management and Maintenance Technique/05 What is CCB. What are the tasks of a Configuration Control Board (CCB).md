# Change Control Board (CCB)  

A **Change Control Board (CCB)** is a formally established group of stakeholders in a software development or maintenance project that is responsible for **reviewing, evaluating, and approving or rejecting proposed changes** to the software system. The CCB ensures that all changes are carefully analyzed for their impact on cost, schedule, quality, and overall project objectives before implementation. It maintains the stability, integrity, and reliability of the software by preventing uncontrolled or unnecessary modifications. The board usually includes representatives from development, testing, project management, and user stakeholders, and it provides a structured process for handling changes systematically.

**Example:**  
In a hospital management system, if a request is made to add an online appointment booking feature, the CCB evaluates its impact on existing modules, development time, system performance, and budget before approving or rejecting the change. This ensures that the system remains reliable and that changes are implemented in a controlled manner.

## Tasks of a Configuration Control Board (CCB)

A Configuration Control Board (CCB) is responsible for managing and controlling all changes to a software system. Its main objective is to ensure that changes are **systematically reviewed, evaluated, approved, and implemented** without negatively affecting the system‚Äôs quality, performance, or schedule.

1. **Review Proposed Changes:**  
    The CCB thoroughly examines all change requests submitted by users, developers, or stakeholders. This review ensures that each proposed change is justified, necessary, and aligns with the system‚Äôs objectives before any further action is taken.
    
2. **Evaluate Impact of Changes:**  
    It assesses how the proposed change will affect the system‚Äôs cost, schedule, quality, functionality, and performance. This step ensures that potential risks, conflicts, or dependencies are identified and mitigated before approval.
    
3. **Approve or Reject Changes:**  
    After a careful evaluation, the CCB decides whether a change should be approved, rejected, or postponed. This prevents unnecessary or harmful modifications from being implemented and maintains system stability.
    
4. **Prioritize Changes:**  
    The CCB determines the order in which approved changes should be implemented based on factors like urgency, criticality, resource availability, and overall project priorities. This ensures efficient use of resources and timely delivery.
    
5. **Monitor Implementation of Changes:**  
    It tracks the progress of approved changes to ensure they are implemented correctly, on time, and according to the agreed specifications. This monitoring prevents errors and deviations during the change process.
    
6. **Maintain Proper Documentation:**  
    The CCB ensures that all change requests, evaluations, approvals, implementation details, and related communications are documented accurately. This provides a historical record for accountability, audits, and future reference.
    
7. **Ensure Compliance with Standards:**  
    It verifies that all changes adhere to organizational policies, coding standards, security requirements, and regulatory guidelines. This maintains the quality, safety, and reliability of the software system.
    
8. **Facilitate Communication Among Stakeholders:**  
    The CCB serves as a central point for communication between developers, testers, project managers, and users. It ensures that all stakeholders are informed about approved changes, implementation plans, and potential impacts.
    
9. **Support Continuous Improvement:**  
    By analyzing patterns of change requests and their impacts, the CCB identifies areas for improvement in the software, development processes, or change management practices, helping the system evolve efficiently.
