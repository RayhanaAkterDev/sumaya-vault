**Software Quality Assurance (SQA):**  
Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is a planned and systematic process that ensures software meets required quality standards and works correctly throughout its development. It focuses on preventing errors, improving processes, and making sure the final software is reliable, efficient, and meets user needs. SQA involves monitoring all stages of development, from requirement analysis and design to coding, testing, and maintenance, to ensure consistency and compliance with standards. It also helps in identifying potential problems early, reducing development costs, and improving overall user satisfaction.

**Example:**  
In a hospital management system, SQA ensures that the patient registration module records information accurately, the appointment module avoids double bookings, and the billing module calculates charges correctly. This helps the system work reliably and reduces errors for both staff and patients.
