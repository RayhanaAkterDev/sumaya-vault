# Activities of a Software Quality Assurance (SQA) Group

**Definition/Introduction:**  
The activities of an SQA group are the specific tasks and actions performed to ensure software meets the required quality standards. These activities support the group‚Äôs responsibilities by monitoring processes, identifying defects, enforcing standards, and improving software quality throughout the development lifecycle.

---

**Key Activities:**

1. **Defining Quality Plans:**  
    Develop detailed quality plans, including objectives, standards, procedures, and schedules for quality assurance. These plans guide the development team and ensure that all quality requirements are addressed systematically.
    
2. **Process Monitoring:**  
    Continuously monitor software development processes to ensure adherence to defined standards and best practices. This includes reviewing activities at each phase‚Äîrequirements, design, coding, and testing‚Äîto maintain process consistency and prevent deviations.
    
3. **Code and Design Reviews:**  
    Conduct formal reviews, inspections, and walkthroughs of software design, code, and documentation. These reviews help identify defects early, improve software quality, and ensure compliance with organizational and industry standards.
    
4. **Testing Coordination:**  
    Plan, organize, and oversee testing activities, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. Ensure that tests are conducted properly and that software meets functional and non-functional requirements.
    
5. **Defect Tracking and Reporting:**  
    Record, track, and report defects identified during development and testing. Ensure that defects are addressed, corrective actions are implemented, and patterns of recurring errors are analyzed to improve future quality.
    
6. **Audits and Compliance Checks:**  
    Conduct regular audits and compliance checks to ensure that processes, work products, and deliverables meet quality standards, legal regulations, and organizational policies.
    
7. **Documentation and Record Keeping:**  
    Maintain accurate records of quality plans, review reports, test results, audits, and process improvements. Proper documentation ensures transparency, accountability, and facilitates knowledge sharing.
    
8. **Training and Support:**  
    Provide guidance, training, and support to development and testing teams on quality standards, tools, and methodologies. This activity helps in raising awareness of quality practices and improving the overall capability of the team.
    
9. **Process Improvement Activities:**  
    Analyze project outcomes, defect data, and feedback to recommend process improvements. Implementing these enhancements helps reduce errors, improve efficiency, and maintain high-quality software in future projects.
