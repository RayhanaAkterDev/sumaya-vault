# Software Reuse

Software reuse is the practice of using existing software components, modules, or code in new applications or systems instead of developing them from scratch. The main goal of software reuse is to save development time, reduce costs, improve reliability, and maintain consistency across projects. By reusing proven components, developers can focus on new functionality while minimizing errors, enhancing productivity, and ensuring better software quality. Software reuse can include code libraries, frameworks, design patterns, or even entire modules.

**Example:**  
A development team creating an e-commerce application can reuse an existing payment gateway module from a previous project instead of building it from scratch. This reduces development time, ensures tested functionality, and improves overall reliability of the new application.
