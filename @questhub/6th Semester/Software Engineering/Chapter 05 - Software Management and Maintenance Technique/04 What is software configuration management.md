# Software Configuration Management (SCM)  

Software Configuration Management is a disciplined process used to **identify, organize, control, and monitor changes** in software throughout its development and maintenance lifecycle. It ensures that all components of a software system‚Äîsuch as source code, documents, libraries, and configuration files‚Äîremain consistent, reliable, and traceable as the software evolves. SCM helps prevent conflicts when multiple developers work on the same system, provides a history of changes for accountability and debugging, and ensures that the software delivered meets its intended requirements.

**Example:**  
In a hospital management system, SCM ensures that any updates to the patient records module, billing module, or appointment system are tracked, changes are controlled, and different developers can work simultaneously without overwriting each other‚Äôs work, maintaining the system‚Äôs integrity and reliability.
