## The professional and ethical responsibilities of a software engineering:

1. **Confidentiality**: Engineers should normally respect the confidentiality of their employers or clients irrespective of whether or not a formal confidentiality agreement has been signed.

2. **Competence**: Engineers should not misrepresent their level of competence. They should not knowingly accept work which is out with their competence.

3. **Work Cooperatively in Teams**: Software development is often done in teams. Engineers should respect others in the team, communicate clearly, and help when needed. Good teamwork improves project quality.

4. **Ensure Software Quality**: Engineers must write clean, reliable, and secure code. They should test the software properly and make sure it works well and meets the client’s needs.

5. **Follow Legal Rules and Licenses**: Engineers should obey software laws like copyright rules, software licenses, and data protection laws. They must not copy code from others without giving credit or using proper licenses.

6. **Take Responsibility for Their Work**: A good engineer does not blame others for mistakes. They take full responsibility for the software they create and are ready to fix any issues caused by it.

7. **Use Skills for Good Purposes**: Software engineers should use their knowledge to help society. They can make useful applications that solve real problems and avoid working on harmful or illegal projects.

8. **Respect Intellectual Property**: Engineers should not steal others’ ideas or code. They must follow rules when using open-source software and give proper credit to original creators.

9. **Computer Misuse**: Software engineers should not use their technical skills to misuse  other people's computers. Computer misuse can range from small issues on a employer's machine/ computer to very serious problems.
