### Characteristics of Legacy Software

1. **Outdated Technology:**  
    Legacy software is developed using old or obsolete programming languages, development tools, and platforms that are no longer widely supported or used in modern software development (e.g., COBOL, Visual Basic 6).
    
2. **Difficult to Maintain:**  
    These systems are often complex and difficult to update or debug. Maintenance becomes challenging due to poorly structured code, limited modularity, and lack of familiarity among current developers.
    
3. **Lack of Proper Documentation:**  
    Many legacy systems were developed without comprehensive documentation, or the documentation is outdated. This makes understanding system behavior and making changes more error-prone and time-consuming.
    
4. **High Maintenance Cost:**  
    Supporting legacy software is costly due to the need for specialized knowledge, older hardware dependencies, or frequent system failures. Often, even small changes require extensive testing and validation.
    
5. **Limited Compatibility:**  
    Legacy software may not be compatible with modern operating systems, hardware, or new applications, creating difficulties in integration, upgrades, or data exchange.
    
6. **Business Critical Systems:**  
    Despite their age, legacy systems often support core business functions such as accounting, payroll, or supply chain management. Replacing them involves high risk and cost, so businesses tend to keep them running.
    
7. **Security Vulnerabilities:**  
    Older software usually lacks modern security standards and patch updates, making it more vulnerable to cyber threats and unauthorized access.
    
8. **Performance Limitations:**  
    Legacy systems often perform slower and are less efficient than modern software due to outdated algorithms, hardware constraints, or inefficient resource usage.
    
9. **Low Scalability:**  
    These systems were not designed to handle modern demands like large user bases, cloud computing, or mobile access, making them hard to scale.
    
10. **Risk of Obsolescence:**  
    With time, it becomes harder to find support, compatible tools, or developers skilled in the legacy technology, increasing the risk of the system becoming completely obsolete.
