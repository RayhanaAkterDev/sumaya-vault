## Definition of software

**Software** is a collection of programs, data, and instructions that enable a computer to perform specific tasks. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the hardware by translating user commands into machine-readable instructions. Unlike hardware, which refers to the physical components of a computer (such as the CPU, memory, and hard drive), software is purely digital and consists of code written in programming languages. Software can serve a variety of purposes, including controlling hardware, processing data, managing system resources, or providing services and entertainment to users. Software can be broadly classified into two main types:

- **System Software**: This includes operating systems and utility programs that manage computer hardware and system resources, providing a platform for running application software.
- **Application Software**: This includes programs designed to help users perform specific tasks, such as word processing, web browsing, or multimedia playback.
