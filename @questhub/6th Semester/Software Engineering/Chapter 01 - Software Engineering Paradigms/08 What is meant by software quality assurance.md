## Software Quality Assurance

**Software Quality Assurance (SQA)** is the process of ensuring that software meets the required quality standards throughout the entire _Software Development Life Cycle_ (SDLC). It is a continuous activity that verifies the software functions correctly, follows established rules and guidelines, and is free from significant errors. SQA involves a planned and systematic set of activities such as testing, code reviews, process improvements, and documentation to ensure the final product is reliable, efficient, and meets both user expectations and regulatory standards.
