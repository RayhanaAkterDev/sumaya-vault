### IEEE Definition of Software Engineering

The *Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)* defines software engineering as:

“The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable *(পরিমাপযোগ্য)* approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software.”

This definition emphasizes the use of organized methods and measurable processes to ensure reliability, efficiency, and quality in software. It extends beyond coding to include the complete lifecycle of a system—covering design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance—supported by suitable tools, techniques, and professional practices.
