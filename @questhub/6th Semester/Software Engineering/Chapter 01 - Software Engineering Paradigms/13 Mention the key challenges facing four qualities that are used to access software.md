Software is evaluated based on several quality attributes that determine its performance, user satisfaction, and long-term reliability. Four important software quality factors are **Functionality**, **Reliability**, **Usability**, and **Efficiency**. Each of these qualities faces distinct challenges during software development and maintenance.

---

1. **Handling Unexpected Inputs and Failures**  
    1. Software must respond correctly to invalid data, sudden crashes, or external failures (like server downtime). Ensuring graceful error handling is a major reliability challenge.
    
2. **Designing User-Friendly Interfaces**  
    1. Creating interfaces that are intuitive for all user levels—beginners to experts—is difficult. Good usability also involves clear navigation, proper layout, and accessibility support for users with disabilities.
    
3. **Optimizing Resource Usage**  
    1. Software should perform its tasks using minimal CPU, memory, and storage. However, writing highly efficient code—especially for large-scale applications—requires deep technical knowledge and testing.
    
4. **Fixing Rare and Intermittent Bugs**  
    1. Bugs that occur under very specific conditions can be hard to reproduce and fix. These types of issues directly affect the reliability of the software and require detailed logging and analysis.
    
5. **Balancing Simplicity and Functionality**  
    1. A usable system should offer all necessary features without overwhelming the user. Striking the right balance between a rich feature set and ease of use is often a design challenge.
    
6. **Ensuring Consistent Behavior Across Environments**  
    1. Software must function reliably on different devices, browsers, or operating systems. Compatibility issues and inconsistent behavior are common challenges for both reliability and efficiency.
    
7. **Preventing Performance Bottlenecks**  
    1. Inefficient algorithms or unoptimized code can slow down software under load. Profiling tools must be used regularly to identify and fix bottlenecks that impact performance.
    
8. **Writing Maintainable Code**  
    1. Maintainability depends on clean code, proper structure, and meaningful comments. Inconsistent naming, tightly coupled modules, or lack of documentation can make future updates hard.
    
9. **Supporting Cross-Platform Performance**  
    1. Efficient performance must be ensured not just on desktops but also on mobile, tablets, or low-end devices. Each platform may require different optimizations.
    
10. **Managing Legacy Code and Technical Debt**  
    1. Older systems may not follow current best practices. Refactoring such systems without breaking functionality is a key maintainability challenge.
    
11. **Gathering and Applying User Feedback**  
    1. Usability testing is time-consuming and iterative. Turning user feedback into actionable design changes while maintaining system stability can be complex.
    
12. **Ensuring Safe Updates and Modifications**  
    1. Frequent updates are necessary, but without adequate testing or version control, these can introduce new bugs. Maintenance should include regression testing and automated builds.
