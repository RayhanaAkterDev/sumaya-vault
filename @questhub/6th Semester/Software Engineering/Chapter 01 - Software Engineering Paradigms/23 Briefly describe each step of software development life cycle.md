# ‚ú®Steps of Software Development Life Cycle

**SDLC** stands for **software development life cycle**. SDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization . It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace, and alter or enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process. There are **seven main phases** in SDLC:

 
1. **Planning**: This is the first and one of the most important steps. The main goal is to understand what the software is supposed to achieve. The team discusses project goals, budget, required resources, and sets deadlines. Risks are also identified in this phase so that they can be handled early. A proper plan is created which guides the entire development process.
 
2. **Requirement Analysis**: In this phase, detailed information is gathered from stakeholders, clients, and users to understand what the software must do. Both functional (what the software should do) and non-functional (performance, security, etc.) requirements are collected and documented in a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) file. This document is a reference for the next phases.

3. **Design**: Here, the software‚Äôs structure is planned based on the requirements. Designers create High-Level Design (HLD) for the system‚Äôs architecture, and Low-Level Design (LLD) for individual modules and components. It includes database designs, user interface design, and how different parts of the software will work together. This blueprint ensures everyone is on the same page before coding starts.

4. **Development**: This is the coding phase where software developers write the actual code using suitable programming languages and tools. Tasks are usually divided among front-end, back-end, and database developers. Everyone follows coding standards to ensure the code is clean and understandable. At the end of this phase, the software is functional and ready for testing.

5. **Testing**: Once the development is complete, the software is tested to check for bugs, errors, and to make sure it works as expected. Different types of testing are done such as unit testing (for individual parts), integration testing (how parts work together), performance testing, and security testing. Any issues found are fixed, and the software is retested.

6. **Deployment**: After successful testing, the software is delivered to the users. It may first be released as a beta version to a small group for feedback. Based on that feedback, improvements are made before the full release. Once the final version is ready, it is installed on the user‚Äôs systems or made available online.

7. **Maintenance**: This is the longest phase and continues after the software is released. It includes fixing bugs that users find, updating the software to stay compatible with new technologies, and adding new features when needed. Regular maintenance keeps the software reliable and useful in the long term.
