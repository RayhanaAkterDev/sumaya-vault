## ✅ Attributes of Quality Software (Good Software Product)

A good software product should possess the following key attributes:

> 1. **Correctness**: The software must accurately perform its intended functions and fulfill all specified requirements without errors.

> 2. **Reliability**: It should operate consistently under expected conditions, ensuring stable performance over time.

> 3. **Efficiency**: The software should use system resources wisely — minimizing memory use, CPU time, and power — while delivering quick responses.

> 4. **Usability**: A good software product should be easy to learn and use, with an intuitive interface that enhances user experience.

> 5. **Maintainability**: The software should be written in a way that makes it easy to modify and evolve to meet changing user or business needs.

> 6. **Portability**: It should run smoothly across different hardware platforms and operating systems with minimal changes.

> 7. **Scalability**: The system should handle increased workloads or user traffic without performance degradation.

> 8. **Security**: The software must protect data and operations from unauthorized access, breaches, and malicious activities.

> 9. **Dependability**: It must be trustworthy, safe, and secure. Even during failures, it should not cause harm or damage, and must resist malicious attacks.

> 10. **Reusability**: Components of the software should be general and modular enough to be reused in other systems or projects.

> 11. **Interoperability**: It should work effectively with other systems and software, enabling data exchange and integration.

> 12. **Acceptability**: The software must meet user expectations. It should be understandable, reliable, and compatible with the users' existing systems and workflows.
