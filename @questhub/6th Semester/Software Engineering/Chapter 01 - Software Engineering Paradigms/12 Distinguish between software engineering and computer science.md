| **Point of Difference** | **Software Engineering**                                                           | **Computer Science**                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition              | Concerned with the practical application of engineering to build software systems. | Concerned with the theoretical study of computation and algorithms.                 |
| Goal                    | To develop high-quality, maintainable, and reliable software products.             | To gain deep understanding of computational processes and logic.                    |
| Nature                  | Practical and project-based, focuses on real-world software problems.              | Theoretical and research-based, focuses on solving abstract problems.               |
| Focus Area              | Emphasizes on designing, testing, maintaining software using engineering methods.  | Emphasizes on algorithms, data structures, automata theory, and computation models. |
| Core Activities         | Includes software development, version control, testing, deployment, etc.          | Includes problem-solving, complexity analysis, theory development, etc.             |
| Tools & Technologies    | Uses IDEs, version control systems, testing tools, SDLC models, etc.               | Uses mathematical models, simulations, proofs, etc.                                 |
| Project Orientation     | Highly team-oriented; involves collaboration, planning, and management.            | Often individual or research-based, especially in early stages.                     |
| End Product             | Functional software systems or applications.                                       | Theoretical results, concepts, and sometimes programming solutions.                 |
| Mathematical Use        | Uses mathematics for logic, testing, and reliability analysis.                     | Deeply rooted in discrete math, logic, and formal methods.                          |
| Career Roles            | Software Engineer, QA Engineer, System Architect, DevOps Engineer.                 | Computer Scientist, Researcher, Data Scientist, Algorithm Designer.                 |
