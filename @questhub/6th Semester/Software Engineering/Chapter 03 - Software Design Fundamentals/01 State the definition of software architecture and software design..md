### Software Architecture

Software architecture is the high-level structure of a software system that defines its overall organization and framework. It identifies the main components, modules, or subsystems of the system and describes how they interact with each other. Architecture emphasizes system-wide decisions‚Äîsuch as performance, scalability, security, and maintainability‚Äîthat are often costly to change later. In essence, it provides the big-picture blueprint and constraints that guide the detailed design and development of the system.

### Software Design

Software design is the process of planning the detailed solution of a software system by translating user requirements into a structured blueprint for implementation. It specifies algorithms, data structures, classes, and interfaces needed to achieve the desired functionality while also considering non-functional aspects such as efficiency, usability, and reliability. Unlike architecture, which defines the system‚Äôs high-level structure, software design focuses on lower-level details, ensuring the system is implementable, maintainable, and adaptable.
