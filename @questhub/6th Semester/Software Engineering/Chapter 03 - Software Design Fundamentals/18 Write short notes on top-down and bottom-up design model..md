## **Top-Down and Bottom-Up Design Model**

Top-down and bottom-up design models are methodologies used to **structure and plan a software system** during the design phase, ensuring it meets functional and non-functional requirements efficiently.

1. **Top-Down Design**  
    In top-down design, the development starts with a **high-level overview** of the entire system. The system is divided into major modules, which are then progressively decomposed into smaller, detailed components. Each module‚Äôs responsibilities, interfaces, and interactions are defined during this process. This approach emphasizes understanding the **overall system functionality** before focusing on details, making it easier to identify major control flows and critical features. Top-down design is particularly effective when requirements are well understood and provides a clear roadmap for the developers. It also helps in identifying potential system constraints early and ensures that all modules align with the overall architecture.
    
2. **Bottom-Up Design**  
    Bottom-up design begins with the **development of low-level modules** that perform specific tasks. These modules are first tested individually, and then integrated step by step to form higher-level components, eventually building the complete system. This approach is effective when **reusable modules** exist or when the system depends heavily on core functionalities. Bottom-up design focuses on ensuring that the **foundational modules are correct and reliable**, promoting modularity and reusability. It also allows developers to leverage existing components, reducing development time and improving consistency.
