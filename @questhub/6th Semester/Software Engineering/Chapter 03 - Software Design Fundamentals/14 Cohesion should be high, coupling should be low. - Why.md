In software engineering, **cohesion** refers to how closely related and focused the responsibilities of a single module or component are. High cohesion means that a module performs a well-defined, specific task and all its parts contribute directly to that task. When cohesion is high, modules are easier to understand, maintain, and test because each module has a clear purpose and minimal unrelated responsibilities.

**Coupling**, on the other hand, refers to the degree of dependency between different modules. Low coupling means that modules interact with each other as little as possible and rely on well-defined interfaces rather than internal details. When coupling is low, changes in one module are less likely to affect others, which improves maintainability, reduces the risk of errors, and allows modules to be reused independently.

Therefore, in good software design, **high cohesion** ensures that each module is focused and manageable, while **low coupling** ensures that modules are independent and flexible. Together, these principles lead to systems that are **easier to maintain, test, and extend** over time.
