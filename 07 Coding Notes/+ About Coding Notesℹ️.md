⬆️:: [[07 Coding Notes|Coding Notes]]


The **Coding Note** is your go-to space for capturing **everything related to programming** — from quick snippets and bug fixes to deeper explanations and learning takeaways.

It’s not about perfection or polished tutorials, but about **recording what you learn, discover, and solve** in the moment.

### 🧠 Best used when:

1. You want to **save code snippets** or common patterns for reuse  
2. You’re **debugging** and need to track errors, fixes, or experiments  
3. You’re learning a new **concept, syntax, or framework**  
4. You want a **personal reference library** for your projects and studies  

> 🚀 Think of it as your **developer’s second brain** — a place where small notes add up to big knowledge over time.
