## ✍️ Content  

I’m Rayhana Akter Sumaya — a CSE student with a strong passion for building beautiful, accessible websites. I’ve just completed the **HTML Fundamentals** phase of my learning, and I wanted to mark this milestone by sharing my progress publicly.

📚 So far, I’ve learned to:

- Structure web pages using clean, semantic HTML    
- Work with text, lists, links, images, and media    
- Build forms with validation and accessibility    
- Understand block vs inline elements and HTML entities

🔧 Behind the scenes:

- I’ve kept organized notes in Obsidian    
- Practiced each topic with mini projects    
- Documented everything in a GitHub repo    

🎯 **Next Step**: CSS Foundations — layouts, styling, and responsiveness!

This is just the beginning. I’m here to **learn, grow, and connect** with the tech community. If you're also learning frontend, feel free to connect — let’s grow together! 💬
