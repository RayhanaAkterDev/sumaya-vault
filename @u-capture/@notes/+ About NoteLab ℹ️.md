‚¨ÜÔ∏è:: [[@notes|NoteLab]]

The **NoteLab** acts as your default **Inbox** for capturing quick [[Fleeting Notes]] 

It's the ideal space to **jot down anything instantly** ‚Äî thoughts, ideas, tasks ‚Äî without worrying about structure or organization.

### üß† Best used when:
- You need to capture something **immediately**
- You create many notes but don‚Äôt have time to sort them right away
- **Frictionless capture** is more important than structure

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you prefer a **minimalist Vault**, you can choose to keep all your raw notes here permanently and just search as needed.

Let me know if you'd like a version with a callout block or icons added for visual effect.
