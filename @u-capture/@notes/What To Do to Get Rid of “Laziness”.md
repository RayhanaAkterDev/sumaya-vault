🔁 Use the “2:1 Ratio” to Force Energy

For every 2 tasks that are brain-based (study/code),
Do 1 that is body-based (pray, stretch, shower, walk, skincare).

🧼 Reset Physically to Break the Freeze

Force yourself to do these 3 things in the morning — no matter what:

1. Brush your teeth & wash face
2. Drink a glass of cold water
3. Change your clothes (even to fresh home wear)

This resets your nervous system and helps break the fog.

💣 Brutal Truth (But With Kindness)

Laziness isn’t your problem. Disconnection is.

You’re disconnected from:

1. Your purpose
2. Your body
3. Your routine
4. Allah
5. Your dream future self

Reconnection doesn’t come from guilt.
It comes from small actions done repeatedly, even when you feel nothing.
