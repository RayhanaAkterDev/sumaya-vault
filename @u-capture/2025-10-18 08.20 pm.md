### How to Be a Creator in Your Coding Journey

1. **Turn Learning into Projects**    
    - Don’t just watch tutorials or read docs.        
    - Example: Learned about arrays in JavaScript? **Build a small to-do list app** to use arrays in practice.        
    - Learned a new React hook? **Add it to your portfolio project.**        

2. **Document & Share Your Work**    
    - Write mini blog posts, notes, or GitHub READMEs about what you learned.        
    - Example: Create a **step-by-step guide** on deploying a React app on Netlify.        

3. **Automate or Solve Real Problems**    
    - Apply new skills to **solve small, real-life problems**.        
    - Example: Build a **personal expense tracker**, a **study planner**, or a **simple chatbot**.

4. **Iterate on Your Own Ideas**    
    - Start tiny personal projects and **improve them over time**.        
    - Example: Build a **portfolio website**, then add a **blog**, then add **AI-powered features**.
       
5. **Teach What You Learn**    
    - Teaching is creating.        
    - Example: Make short **tutorial videos**, write **code snippets**, or help friends with coding problems.

💡 **Key Principle:**  
Every day, instead of just “learning code,” think:

> “What can I **create today** with what I learned?”

Even a **small script, mini-app, or note on GitHub** counts. Over time, this habit turns you into a **Deep Generalist + Creator**, making your skills **highly demandable** and your portfolio **stand out**.
