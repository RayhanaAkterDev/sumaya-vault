###### _Time blocking_

- _Deep Work (90 min):_ Focus fully on coding or studying.    
- _Shallow Work (30–60 min):_ Handle emails, notes, or routine tasks.

**Define a goal for each block:**
- Write a one-line objective at the start.    
- During deep work, avoid distractions completely.

_Use focus tools:_ Like **Forest**. 1 focus session = 1 tree 🌳

 _Stop when time’s up:_ When the time is over, stop and record your progress. Then create a new task and assign time for it.

###### _Define True outcome_

- For example: Complete `Tea House` #project within **2025-10-14**

###### _Break It Down_ 
- `Hero section`
- `Featured products section`
- `About / Great Tea section`
- `Clients / Testimonials section`
- `News & Events section`
- `Footer section`

###### _Build through small tasks_ 

Task duration should be between 30-120 minutes.

###### _Set timebox for each task_ 

- Assign a fixed time for every task — for example, 1 hour. 
- When the time is up, stop working, even if it’s not finished. 
- If needed, create a new task named **“Continue…”**     
- 👉 This helps reduce perfectionism and keeps work moving forward.

###### ⏳ _Time Blocking_

###### _Define ‘Done’ for each task_
