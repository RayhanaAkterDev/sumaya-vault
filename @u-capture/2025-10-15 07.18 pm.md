#### 📝 **Note:** How Absolute & Relative Positioning Work

1. `position: absolute` positions an element **based on the nearest parent** that has `position: relative`, `absolute`, or `fixed`.    
2. If no such parent exists, it positions **relative to the whole page (viewport)**.    
3. To make an absolutely positioned element stay inside a specific box —  
    → Make that parent box `relative`.  
    → Or move the element **inside** a parent that is already `relative`.    
4. Common pattern in Tailwind:

	```css
	.parent { @apply relative; }
	.child  { @apply absolute bottom-0 left-0; }
	```

✅ This ensures the child stays anchored inside the parent.

**Quick rule:**  👉 _Absolute needs a relative parent to know where to stay._
