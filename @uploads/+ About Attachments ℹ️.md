⬆️:: [[12 Attachments|Attachments]]

Attachments in Obsidian include any media files such as images, PDFs, audio, videos, or documents that are embedded or linked inside your notes.

To keep your vault organized, it's best to store all attachments in a dedicated folder — like `Media`, `Assets`, or `Attachments`.

### 📁 Where Are Attachments Stored?

You can set the default location for new attachments:

> **Settings → Files & Links → Default location for new attachments**

- Choose **“In a folder”**    
- Pick or create a folder like: `Media/`, `Assets/`, or `Resources/`

#### 📌 Best Practices

- 📦 **Centralize:** Use one folder for all media to keep your vault tidy.    
- 🖼️ **Name Clearly:** Rename images/files for easy reference.    
- 🗂️ **Structure:** Use subfolders (e.g., `Media/Images`, `Media/PDFs`) if needed.    
- ♻️ **Move old attachments** manually into your media folder for consistency.
