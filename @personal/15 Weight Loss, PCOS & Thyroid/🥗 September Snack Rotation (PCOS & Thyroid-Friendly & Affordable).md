## Tips for Implementation

- **Timing:**  
  - Mid-morning snack → prevents overeating at lunch  
  - Evening snack → prevents late-night sugar cravings  
- **Portion control:** Keep snacks small & balanced, avoid overeating even if healthy  
- **Rotation:** Use substitutes (cucumber, carrot, sweet potato, sprouted moong) if fruits aren’t affordable that week  
- **Drink combo:** Pair snacks with 1 glass of water or morning/afternoon drink to improve satiety
