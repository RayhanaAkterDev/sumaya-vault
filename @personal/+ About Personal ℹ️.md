The **Personal** folder is your **private space** for tracking self-care, habits, and anything related to your well-being beyond academics or productivity.

It’s a calming area in your vault — meant for **reflecting on yourself**, your routines, and what helps you feel good.

### 🧠 Best used when:

- You want to maintain or improve **self-care routines**    
- You’re documenting tips, experiments, or reflections related to your **health or lifestyle** 
- You need a mental break from structure and just want to **note things for your future self**    

> 🌿 This space is about **nurturing yourself** — slow, gentle progress matters here more than perfection.
