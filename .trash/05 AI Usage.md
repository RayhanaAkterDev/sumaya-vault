# 🤖 AI in My Developer Journey

**Purpose**: This note defines **how I use AI** (especially ChatGPT) as a learning tool — not a replacement for understanding or effort. It helps me stay intentional, grow independent, and become a confident full stack developer.

---

## 🎯 My AI Usage Purpose

I use AI to:

- Understand new concepts quickly
- Generate documentation and structure for my repositories
- Review or clean up code I’ve written
- Break down errors or bugs I can’t solve on my own
- Get boilerplate or starter templates for new ideas
- Enhance my notes and learning systems

---

## 🚫 What I Will Not Use AI For Anymore

I will no longer:

- Use AI to write **entire code demos first** without trying myself
- Let AI **complete projects** where I’ve not even touched the code
- Postpone practice with the excuse: *"I’ll try it later after completing the repo"*
- Treat AI as a shortcut to **avoid the struggle** that real learning requires

---

## ✅ My Coding-First Rule (The Golden Rule)

> 🔁 **If I haven’t tried to write the code with my own brain and hands first, I won’t ask AI to generate it.**

#### 🔹 Step 1: I try to write the demo **MYSELF first**

- Even if I fail or don’t know where to start
- I use only the README concept as guidance

#### 🔹 Step 2: I ask AI to generate the official demo **after my attempt**

- I compare mine with **Soulbot's** version
- I notice what I missed or misunderstood

#### 🔹 Step 3: I **run both versions** in a code editor or sandbox

- I test behaviors
- I play with values
- I break and fix it intentionally

#### 🔹 Step 4: I reflect with:

```markdown
### 🔍 What I Learned:
- I understood this part well:
- I struggled with:
- What I’ll try next:
```

## 🧠 Why This Rule Matters

This approach ensures that:

- My **brain learns** by doing, not just watching    
- I develop **real-world debugging skill**    
- I become less **dependent** and more **independent**    
- My repo becomes a **proof of skill**, not just content    

---

## 💡 When It’s Okay to Ask AI First

I _can_ use AI first for:

- Planning a file structure    
- Drafting a README intro or explanation    
- Generating styles or UI mock code after building the logic    
- Exploring alternate ways to do what I’ve already coded    
- Reviewing final versions or writing commit messages    

---

## 🧭 My AI Usage Checklist

Before using AI for code:

-  Have I tried to code this myself?    
-  Do I understand the concept from the README?    
-  Did I run and explore the last topic practically?    
-  Will this request teach me something I’ll remember?    
-  Am I thinking like a builder, not a copier?    

If all ✅ → Proceed  
If ❌ → Slow down and try first

## 📌 Final Reminder

> ✨ I am not learning to copy code.  
> I’m learning to **build** with my logic, practice, and strategy — with AI as a sharp tool, not a crutch.
