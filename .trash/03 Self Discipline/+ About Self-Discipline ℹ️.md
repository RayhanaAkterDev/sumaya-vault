The **Self-Discipline** folder is your space for building a resilient, focused, and consistent mindset. Here, you can collect notes that strengthen your personal willpower, motivation, and long-term habits.

It is ideal for storing resources that help you **stay on track** and avoid distractions, so you can achieve your goals even when motivation fades.

### 🧠 Best used when:

- You want to design or track positive habits    
- You collect motivational quotes, stories, or frameworks    
- You need reminders of **why** you are staying disciplined    
- You reflect on setbacks and how to overcome them    

> ⚠️ Remember: **Self-discipline is a skill** — the more you practice, the stronger it gets. This folder supports that practice.
