## Quick Details / Context

### ✍️ What is Obsidian?

Obsidian is a **Markdown-based note-taking app** that turns plain text into a **linked knowledge base**. It stores notes **locally**, giving you full control over your data.

---

### 🧩 Core Concepts

- **Notes** — Each note is a `.md` file. Write anything.
- **Links** — Use `[[Note Name]]` to connect notes.
- **Tags** — Use `#tag` to label and filter notes.
- **Folders** — Keep notes grouped; don’t over-organize.

---

### ⚙️ Key Features

- **Backlinks** — See where a note is mentioned.
- **Graph View** — Visualize how notes connect.
- **Daily Notes** — A new note for each day.
- **Templates** — Reuse common formats.
- **Command Palette** — Quick access to commands (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`).
