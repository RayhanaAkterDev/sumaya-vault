# 🔁 100-Hour Deep Focus Practice

**Start Date:** 7 June, 2025

> **Target**: 100 focused, quality hours of coding.

---

## 1. 🎯 Focus Only Counts if It's Deep

> [!todo] **Do's**
> 
> - Work on **one weakness or topic** at a time.
>     
> - Ask yourself: _“Was this a deep, focused hour?”_
>     
> - **Practice with purpose**—not randomly.
>     

> [!failure] **Don'ts**
> 
> - Avoid distractions, switching tabs, or multitasking.
>     
> - Don’t switch topics mid-session—it breaks focus.
>     
> - Avoid 5-min study bursts—they’re too shallow.
>     

> ❌ No deep focus = Doesn't count toward 100 hours.  
> _Only deep, clear, distraction-free sessions count._

## 2. ⏱ Session Plan: 1–2 Hours Max

> [!todo] **Do's**
> 
> - Keep each session between 1 to 2 hours.
>     
> - Structure your session clearly:
>     
>     - **Topic Prep (15 mins max)**
>         
>         - Watch 1 short video **or** skim docs.
>             
>         - Aim for basic understanding—it's okay to not fully get it.

>             
>     - **Code Practice (30–60 mins)**
>         
>         - Build or practice something immediately.
>             
>         - Use code snippets or mini projects.
>             
>         - Focus on **visual feedback/results**.
>             
>         - Apply what you learn **right away**.
>             

> [!failure] **Don'ts**
> 
> - Don’t delay coding after learning.
>     
> - Don’t just consume content—act on it.
>

## 8. 📊 Track Every Hour

> [!todo] **Do's**
> 
> - Log hours in a table, tracker, or journal.
>

| Date       | Topic               | Hours | Notes / Reflection                        |
|------------|---------------------|-------|-------------------------------------------|
| 07 Jun 25  | Flexbox Basics      | 1     | Confused by `align-items`, now clear.     |
| 08 Jun 25  | Pseudo-classes      | 1.5   | Used `:hover` in a button UI practice.    |

> 🏁 **Reminder:** 100 Hours ≠ Time Passed  
> You’re building skill—not just logging hours.
