It's a place to **define how you think**, not just what you think.

The **Strategies** folder acts as your **thinking toolkit** — a dedicated space for refining how you learn, work smartly, and build systems that support long-term success.

### 🧠 Best used when:

- You're exploring ways to **study smarter or work more efficiently**    
- You want to develop **repeatable, reusable processes**    
- You need a place to **formalize your mindset** or approach to any task    

>💡 Treat this as your **personal strategy guidebook** — update it as you learn, evolve, or discover what works best for you.
