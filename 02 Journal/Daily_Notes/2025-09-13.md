## 📓 Reflection

- ✅ **What went well today?**    
    - Successfully completed collecting all chapter answers for `ESP`.        
- ⚡ **What distracted me?**    
    - Couldn’t finish some planned tasks:        
        - Having my bedtime tea/drink            
        - Cleaning the room            
        - Completing Chapter 4 of `TOC`            
- 🎯 **What to improve tomorrow?**    
    - Stay consistent with small daily habits (tea, cleaning).        
    - Dedicate focused time to finish pending `TOC` work.
