### Self-Discipline
-  Do one hard work intentionally early
-  Do self-reflect regularly

## Self-Reflection

- After answering the first three questions, I took a 15-minute break. During that time, I scrolled through my phone and downloaded two exercise apps. 
- Also I took 5 mins to write this self-reflection of mine.

> [!quote] Note: *The break helped me relax, but I want to be more intentional with my screen time during breaks. Next time, I’ll try to stretch or walk instead of scrolling.*

### ✨ Daily Reminder:  
>"Today's small victories will build tomorrow's big dreams. Finish what you started."

>"When you say you’ll do something — do it.  
Every task is a promise.  
The more promises you keep, the more your brain learns: _I can trust you._  
And trust builds confidence.  
Confidence becomes unstoppable energy."
