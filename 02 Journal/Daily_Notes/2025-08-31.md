## Reflection

💣 Brutal Truth (But With Kindness)

Laziness isn’t your problem. Disconnection is.

You’re disconnected from:

1. Your purpose
2. Your body
3. Your routine
4. Allah
5. Your dream future self

> Reconnection doesn’t come from guilt.  
> It comes from small actions, done consistently,  
> even when you feel nothing at all.
