The **MOCs** folder holds your curated **Map of Content** notes 🗺️ — high-level overviews that connect related notes into meaningful clusters.

Use this space to organize, visualize, and explore your vault with structure and intention.

### 🧠 Best used when:
- You want to create overviews of related notes or topics
- You’re building thematic or project-based collections
- You need a central entry point into your knowledge system

> 💡 MOCs act like custom dashboards — helping you spot patterns, fill gaps, and connect ideas.
