### Basic Features of ASP

1. **Server-Side Scripting** â€“ ASP executes scripts on the server before sending the final HTML to the client. This allows web pages to be dynamic, responding to user inputs, database queries, and other events, rather than being static like plain HTML pages.
    
2. **Support for Multiple Scripting Languages** â€“ Developers can use **VBScript**, **JavaScript**, or other COM-compatible scripting languages to write server-side code, giving flexibility in programming style and ease of integration with existing applications.
    
3. **Database Integration** â€“ ASP can easily connect to databases such as **SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle**, or Access to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data. This enables the creation of interactive web applications like online shopping, forms, or content management systems.
    
4. **Session and Application Management** â€“ ASP supports **session variables** for tracking individual user activity and **application variables** for data shared across all users. This feature is essential for user authentication, personalized content, and maintaining user-specific data.
    
5. **Component Integration** â€“ ASP can use **COM components** or ActiveX objects to extend functionality, such as sending emails, generating reports, handling files, or performing complex calculations.
    
6. **Error Handling** â€“ ASP provides built-in error handling methods like `On Error Resume Next` and `Server.GetLastError`, allowing developers to manage runtime errors gracefully and improve user experience.
    
7. **Integration with IIS** â€“ ASP is tightly integrated with **Internet Information Services (IIS)**, providing enhanced deployment, performance, security, and administrative management for web applications.

### Advantages of ASP

1. Allows creation of **dynamic and interactive web pages** that can respond to user inputs and events.
    
2. Provides **easy integration with databases**, enabling real-time data management and content updates.
    
3. Supports **session and application management**, making it ideal for e-commerce, login systems, and personalized websites.
    
4. Compatible with **multiple scripting languages**, giving flexibility to developers.
    
5. Provides **built-in error handling** to improve stability and user experience.
    
6. **Rapid development** â€“ ASP allows quick development of web applications without complex server configuration.
    
7. **Component-based architecture** â€“ Reusable components reduce development time and simplify maintenance.
    
8. **Secure communication** â€“ Works with IIS to support SSL/TLS for secure data transmission.

### Disadvantages of ASP

1. Runs **only on Windows servers**, which limits cross-platform compatibility.
    
2. May have **performance issues** with very high traffic websites if scripts are not optimized.
    
3. Requires **knowledge of scripting languages** like VBScript or JavaScript.
    
4. Less flexible and modern compared to newer frameworks like **ASP.NET**, **PHP**, or **Node.js** for large-scale applications.
    
5. **Limited support for non-Microsoft technologies**, which can restrict integration with some open-source tools.
    
6. Debugging and maintenance can be **complex for large applications** due to inline scripting.
