### Apache Web Server Architecture

The **Apache web server architecture** follows a **modular and process-based design**, which makes it flexible, scalable, and efficient for handling web requests. Its main components and workflow are:

1. **Parent Process (Main Server Process)** â€“ This process starts when Apache launches. It reads the configuration files, initializes settings, and manages child processes or threads. The parent process does not handle client requests directly but oversees server operations.
    
2. **Child Processes / Worker Threads** â€“ These are responsible for handling actual client requests. Depending on the Multi-Processing Module (MPM) used, Apache can use **process-based**, **thread-based**, or a hybrid model:    
    - **Prefork MPM** â€“ Uses multiple child processes, each handling one request at a time.  
    - **Worker MPM** â€“ Uses multiple threads per child process, allowing each thread to handle one request, which improves efficiency.        
    - **Event MPM** â€“ Optimized for handling persistent connections efficiently, useful for high-traffic servers.
        
3. **Modules** â€“ Apache is highly modular. Core modules provide essential functionality, while additional modules can be loaded for extra features such as:    
    - Authentication and security        
    - URL rewriting and redirection        
    - Compression and caching        
    - Support for scripting languages like PHP, Python, or Perl
        
4. **Configuration Files** â€“ Apache uses configuration files (like `httpd.conf` or `.htaccess`) to define server settings, modules, virtual hosts, access rules, and performance parameters.
    
5. **Request Handling Flow** â€“ When a client sends an HTTP/HTTPS request:    
    - The **parent process** receives the connection and assigns it to a child process or thread.        
    - The **child process** reads the request, checks modules and configuration, and generates a response.        
    - The response is sent back to the client, and the process becomes ready for the next request.
        
6. **Logging and Monitoring** â€“ Apache keeps detailed logs for requests, errors, and access statistics, which help in debugging, security auditing, and performance analysis.
