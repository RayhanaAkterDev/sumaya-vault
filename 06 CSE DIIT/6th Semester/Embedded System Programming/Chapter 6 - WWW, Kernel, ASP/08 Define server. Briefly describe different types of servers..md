# Server

A **server** is a computer system or software program that provides services, resources, or data to other computers, called clients, over a network. Servers are designed to handle multiple simultaneous requests efficiently and ensure that clients can access shared resources, applications, or information securely. They play a vital role in networking, cloud computing, and enterprise environments by centralizing data and services.

## Types of Servers

1. **Web Server** â€“ A web server stores, processes, and delivers web pages to clients over the internet using protocols like HTTP or HTTPS. It handles multiple simultaneous requests, manages web content, and ensures fast response times for users accessing websites. Examples include **Apache** and **Nginx**.
    
2. **File Server** â€“ A file server manages and stores files centrally, allowing multiple users or clients to upload, download, or share files over a network. It ensures secure access control, version management, and efficient file storage. Examples include **Windows File Server** and **Samba**.
    
3. **Database Server** â€“ Database servers provide database services to client applications. They store, retrieve, and manage structured data efficiently, handling large volumes of queries while ensuring data consistency and integrity. Examples include **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**.
    
4. **Mail Server** â€“ Mail servers manage the sending, receiving, and storage of emails for clients using standard email protocols such as **SMTP**, **POP3**, and **IMAP**. They handle multiple mail accounts, filter spam, and ensure reliable message delivery. Examples include **Microsoft Exchange** and **Postfix**.
    
5. **Print Server** â€“ A print server manages printers on a network, receiving print requests from multiple clients, queuing jobs, and sending them to the appropriate printer. It ensures fair access and efficient printer usage, especially in office environments.
    
6. **Application Server** â€“ Application servers provide business logic and backend services to client applications. They execute complex tasks, support web applications, and often interact with database servers to deliver dynamic content. Examples include **JBoss** and **Tomcat**.
    
7. **Proxy Server** â€“ A proxy server acts as an intermediary between clients and other servers. It can provide security by hiding client IPs, cache frequently accessed resources to improve speed, and filter content or enforce access policies.
    
8. **DNS Server** â€“ Domain Name System (DNS) servers translate human-readable domain names into IP addresses, enabling clients to locate resources and connect to servers on the internet efficiently. They are critical for web browsing and network communication.
