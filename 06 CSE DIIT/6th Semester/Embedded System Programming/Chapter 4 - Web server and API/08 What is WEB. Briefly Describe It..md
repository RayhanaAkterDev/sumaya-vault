### **Web**

The **Web** (World Wide Web) is a system of interconnected documents, multimedia, and resources that can be accessed over the Internet using web browsers. It uses a client-server model where a userâ€™s device (client) requests information from web servers through the **HTTP/HTTPS protocols**. The content is usually presented in web pages, which are built using technologies like **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

The Web is not the Internet itself but one of its most popular services, alongside email, file transfer, and messaging. It revolutionized communication, information sharing, and business by making resources universally accessible.

### **Key Features of the Web**

1. **Hyperlinking:**  
    Web pages are interconnected through hyperlinks, allowing users to easily navigate from one document or site to another.
    
2. **Client-Server Architecture:**  
    The Web follows a client-server model, where the browser (client) sends requests and the server responds with the requested resources.
    
3. **Platform Independence:**  
    Web resources can be accessed on any device (PC, tablet, mobile) and operating system using a browser.
    
4. **Multimedia Support:**  
    The Web integrates text, images, audio, video, and animations, offering rich and interactive experiences.
    
5. **Dynamic and Interactive Content:**  
    With technologies like JavaScript, PHP, and AJAX, the Web supports dynamic pages, user interaction, and real-time updates.
    
6. **Global Accessibility:**  
    Anyone with an Internet connection can access web resources, breaking geographical barriers and making information universally available.
    
7. **Standardized Protocols:**  
    The Web is built on standards like HTTP/HTTPS for communication, HTML for structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript for interactivity, ensuring consistency across platforms.
    
8. **Search and Navigation:**  
    Search engines help users locate specific information quickly, while navigation structures (menus, links) guide browsing.
    
9. **Scalability:**  
    The Web can handle millions of users and massive amounts of content, supporting everything from small blogs to global platforms like YouTube or Facebook.
    
10. **Support for E-Commerce and Online Services:**  
    The Web facilitates online transactions, banking, shopping, education, entertainment, and other digital services.
    
11. **Interconnectivity:**  
    Web technologies enable integration with databases, APIs, and cloud services, making applications more powerful and flexible.
    
12. **Security Features:**  
    Through HTTPS, encryption, authentication, and secure payment systems, the Web ensures safer communication and data protection.

âœ… **Example:**  
When a user types _www.google.com_ in a browser, the request goes to Googleâ€™s web server, which sends back a web page containing the search interface.
