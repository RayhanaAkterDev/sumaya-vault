### **Data Object**

A **Data Object** is a software entity that represents and manages data within a program or application. It acts as a container that holds information in the form of attributes (data fields) and may also include methods to process or manipulate that information. In simple terms, it provides a structured way to organize and work with data so that applications can easily store, retrieve, and update information.

Data objects are widely used in programming, databases, and distributed systems. They allow data to be exchanged between applications in a consistent format and ensure that information is treated as a single unit rather than scattered variables.

### **Functions of a Data Object**

1. **Encapsulation of Data:**  
    Groups related information into a single unit, making it easier to organize and manage.
    
2. **Data Representation:**  
    Represents real-world entities such as a student, employee, or product with attributes like name, ID, or price.
    
3. **Data Manipulation:**  
    Provides operations (methods) to modify or process the stored data, such as updating records or performing calculations.
    
4. **Data Transfer:**  
    Used as a medium to pass structured information between applications, layers of a program, or across networks.
    
5. **Reusability and Modularity:**  
    A well-defined data object can be reused in multiple applications, improving modularity and reducing redundancy.
    
6. **Integration with Databases:**  
    Acts as an interface between applications and databases, making it easier to fetch, update, and manage records in a consistent way.
