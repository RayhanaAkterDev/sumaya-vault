## XPath (XML Path Language)

**XPath** (XML Path Language) is a standard language used to navigate and select specific elements, attributes, or data within an XML document. It allows precise traversal of the XML document‚Äôs hierarchical structure using paths, conditions, and relationships between nodes. XPath can select individual nodes or groups of nodes, apply filters to refine selections (for example, selecting all `<book>` elements where the author is ‚ÄúSumaya‚Äù), and navigate axes such as parent, child, ancestor, descendant, and sibling nodes. It is widely used in conjunction with XSLT to locate XML nodes for transformation and can work with any XML document regardless of platform or programming language. By providing powerful selection and filtering capabilities, XPath enables efficient querying, processing, and transformation of XML data.

**Example:** Given an XML file with books and authors, the XPath expression `/books/book[author='Sumaya']/title` selects the `<title>` node of the book authored by ‚ÄúSumaya‚Äù, which would return **Programming Basics**.
