## XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations)

**XSLT** is a **language used to transform XML documents** into other formats such as HTML, plain text, or another XML structure. It works by applying a set of **rules and templates** defined in an XSLT stylesheet to the source XML document, producing a new output document. XSLT enables developers to display, format, and restructure XML data dynamically without modifying the original XML file.

XSLT works on the **Document Object Model (DOM)** of an XML file, matching patterns in XML elements and applying templates to generate the desired output. It supports conditional processing, looping, and functions for data manipulation, making it a powerful tool for XML-based web applications, reporting, and data exchange.

**Example:** Suppose an XML file contains a list of books with titles and authors. Using XSLT, you can transform this XML into an HTML table that displays the books neatly on a web page, without changing the original XML data.
