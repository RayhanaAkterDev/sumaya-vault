## SOSE (Service-Oriented Software Engineering)

**Service-Oriented Software Engineering (SOSE)** is an approach to software development that focuses on **building applications using reusable and loosely coupled services**. In SOSE, software systems are composed of independent services that communicate over a network using standard protocols. Each service performs a specific business function and can be combined with other services to create complex applications. This approach promotes flexibility, scalability, and rapid development by enabling developers to reuse existing services instead of building functionality from scratch.

SOSE emphasizes **service reuse, interoperability, and modularity**, allowing systems to adapt quickly to changing business requirements. Services can be discovered and invoked dynamically, often through web services or cloud-based platforms. SOSE is widely used in enterprise systems, cloud computing, and distributed applications where integration of heterogeneous components is essential.

**Example:** In an e-commerce application, separate services may handle payment processing, inventory management, and customer notifications. Using SOSE, these services can be developed independently and then combined to build the complete application efficiently.
