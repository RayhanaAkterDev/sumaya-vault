### Linker

A **linker** is a software tool that takes one or more **object files** generated by a compiler or assembler and combines them into a **single executable program**. It resolves all **symbolic references** between the object files, such as function calls or variable accesses, by assigning actual memory addresses to these symbols. The linker also includes any necessary **library functions** and performs **relocation**, adjusting addresses so the program can run correctly in memory. Linkers are essential for **modular programming**, where a program is divided into multiple source files or modules, ensuring that all parts of the program work together seamlessly.

**Example:**  
If a program has `main.o` (main function) and `math.o` (math functions), the linker combines them into a single executable and links calls like `add(5, 10)` in `main.o` to the `add` function defined in `math.o`.
