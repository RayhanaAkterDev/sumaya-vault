### Single Pass Compiler

A **Single Pass Compiler** is a type of compiler that reads the source code only once from start to finish. During this single reading, it performs all the major phases of compilation, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation. Because it processes the code in just one pass, it is generally faster and requires less memory compared to compilers that make multiple passes. However, this efficiency comes with limitations: single pass compilers are less capable of handling complex programming constructs and performing advanced code optimizations, which can be a drawback for large or intricate programs. They are usually suitable for simple programming languages or embedded systems where speed and low memory usage are priorities.

### Multi-Pass Compiler

A **Multi-Pass Compiler** is a compiler that reads the source code multiple times, with each pass dedicated to a specific phase of compilation such as syntax checking, semantic analysis, optimization, or code generation. By dividing the compilation process into multiple passes, it can handle complex programming constructs more effectively and produce optimized code. While multi-pass compilers consume more memory and take longer to compile programs compared to single pass compilers, they are more powerful and flexible. They are commonly used for complex programming languages like C++ or Java, where advanced optimizations and thorough error checking are important for producing efficient and reliable executables.
