### Differences Between Single Pass and Multi-Pass Compiler

|Feature|Single Pass Compiler|Multi-Pass Compiler|
|---|---|---|
|**Number of Passes**|Reads the source code only once.|Reads the source code multiple times, each pass handling a specific task.|
|**Compilation Speed**|Faster because of a single reading.|Slower due to multiple readings of the code.|
|**Memory Requirement**|Requires less memory.|Requires more memory for storing intermediate information.|
|**Handling Complex Programs**|Less capable of handling complex constructs or large programs.|Can handle complex constructs and large programs efficiently.|
|**Code Optimization**|Limited or no advanced optimization.|Allows better optimization of code for performance and size.|
|**Error Detection**|May detect fewer errors, mainly syntax errors.|Can detect more errors including semantic and logical issues.|
|**Flexibility**|Less flexible for advanced language features.|More flexible, can implement advanced features like inline expansion or loop optimization.|
|**Use Case**|Suitable for simple languages or embedded systems.|Suitable for complex languages like C, C++, or Java.|
|**Intermediate Code**|Often generates code directly without storing intermediate representation.|Generates intermediate code in early passes before final code generation.|
|**Resource Efficiency**|Efficient in terms of time and memory for small programs.|Less efficient in time and memory but produces better optimized code.|
