## Define system programming? Explain the components of system programming

**Components of System Programming**

System programming focuses on developing software that manages and controls computer hardware, enabling the execution of application programs. The following are the main components involved in system programming:

- **Compiler:** Translates high-level programming language code into low-level machine or assembly code. It includes stages such as lexical and syntax analysis, semantic checking, optimization, and code generation to produce efficient executables.
- **Assembler:** A system program that translates assembly language instructions into machine code. It performs symbol resolution, instruction translation, and assigns memory locations so the processor can execute the program correctly.
- **Linker:** Combines multiple object files generated by compilers into a single executable file. It also resolves address references, enabling seamless execution across different program modules.    
- **Loader:** Responsible for loading executable code into main memory for execution. It allocates memory space, resolves symbolic references, and prepares the program environment to run properly on the system.
- **Operating System (OS):** Core system software that interfaces between hardware and user programs. It manages resources like memory, CPU, and I/O devices, and provides essential services such as file management, multitasking, and process control.
- **Device Drivers:** Specialized programs that enable the operating system and applications to communicate with hardware devices. They act as a bridge, ensuring correct functioning of components like printers, keyboards, and graphics cards.
- **System Libraries and Utilities:** Libraries provide reusable functions for programs, while utilities are special-purpose tools for system maintenance (e.g., file management, backup, disk cleanup). Together, they support smooth program execution and keep the system efficient.

- **Macro Processor:** Handles macros, which are pre-defined code sequences. It replaces macro calls with actual code blocks before compilation or assembly, reducing code repetition and improving programmer productivity.
    
- **Debugger:** A tool used to detect and fix errors in programs. It allows step-by-step execution, setting breakpoints, and inspecting variable values at runtime, helping identify logical or runtime issues effectively.
    
- **Interpreter:** Directly executes high-level source code line by line without prior translation into machine code. This approach facilitates easier debugging and testing but often results in slower execution compared to compiled programs.
