##  Design of an Embedded System

The **design of an embedded system** involves developing both the **hardware and software** parts of a dedicated device. It aims to make the system reliable, compact, cost-effective, and capable of performing tasks efficientlyâ€”often in **real-time**.

Designing such a system requires a series of well-defined steps.

### Basic Design Steps

1. **Requirement Analysis**  
   - Understand the systemâ€™s purpose and functionalities (e.g., monitoring temperature or controlling speed).

2. **Hardware Design**  
   - Choose a suitable **microcontroller** or **processor**.  
   - Add required components such as **sensors, actuators, memory**, and **display units**.

3. **Software Development (Firmware)**  
   - Write embedded code in **C, C++, or Assembly**.  
   - Ensure smooth communication between software and hardware.  
   - Optimize for real-time performance and minimal power use.

4. **Integration & Testing**  
   - Combine the hardware and software.  
   - Test the system in real-time to ensure accurate and stable performance.

### Example

_Design of a Digital Blood Pressure Monitor_

A **digital blood pressure monitor** is a real-life embedded system designed to measure and display blood pressure values automatically.


#### Working Process

1. **Microcontroller**: Acts as the brain, running the embedded software.  
2. **Input Sensors**: Detect cuff pressure during inflation and deflation.  
3. **Processing**:  
   - Calculates **systolic and diastolic** pressure values.  
   - Removes signal noise to increase accuracy.  
4. **Display Output**: Shows the results clearly on an LCD screen.  
5. **User Interface**: Buttons allow users to start, reset, or view stored results.  
6. **Power Management**: Controls battery usage and enables sleep mode when idle.
