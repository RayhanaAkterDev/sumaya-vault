## Define system software

**System software** is a type of software that controls and manages the hardware components of a computer and provides a foundation for running application software. It works in the background to handle system resources like memory, CPU, and input/output devices. System software includes operating systems, device drivers, compilers, assemblers, and utility programs. Its main purpose is to ensure the overall functionality, efficiency, and stability of the system. Unlike application software, which performs specific user tasks, system software enables the system to operate smoothly and supports the execution of other programs.
