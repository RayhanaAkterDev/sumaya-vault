## Differentiate system software and application software

|**System Software**|**Application Software**|
|---|---|
|System software manages and controls the hardware components of a computer and provides a platform for running other software.|Application software is designed to perform specific tasks for users, such as word processing, gaming, or web browsing.|
|It acts as an interface between the hardware and application software.|It directly serves the needs and tasks of the end user.|
|It usually runs in the background and starts automatically when the computer boots.|It runs only when the user launches it and terminates after use.|
|It is essential for the basic operation and functioning of the computer system.|It is not essential for the computer to operate but adds functionality for the user.|
|Users do not typically interact directly with system software; interaction is indirect or through other software.|Users interact directly with application software via graphical user interfaces or commands.|
|Written mostly in low-level or system programming languages such as C or assembly.|Written in high-level languages like Java, Python, or C#.|
|Examples include operating systems, device drivers, assemblers, compilers, and utility programs.|Examples include MS Office, Adobe Photoshop, web browsers, games, and media players.|
|System software manages system resources like CPU scheduling, memory management, and file systems.|Application software focuses on solving user-specific problems and processing data for particular applications.|
|Updates to system software often affect the entire computer’s performance and compatibility.|Updates to application software typically add features or fix bugs related to specific user tasks.|
|System software provides a stable environment for applications to run securely and efficiently.|Application software depends on the system software environment to function|
