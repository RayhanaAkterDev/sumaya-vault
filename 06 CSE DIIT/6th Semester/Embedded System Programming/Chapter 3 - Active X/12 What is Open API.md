### Definition of Open API

An **Open API**, also known as a **Public API**, is an API that is made publicly available to external developers and the general public. It allows third-party applications to access a platformâ€™s services or data without needing to understand the internal workings of the system. Open APIs are designed to encourage **integration, innovation, and collaboration** between different software applications.

Open APIs are usually documented with specifications that describe how to send requests, what responses to expect, and any authentication requirements. They are widely used in web and mobile applications to enable external developers to extend functionality without accessing the underlying code.

**Example:**  
The **Google Maps API** is an Open API that allows developers to integrate maps, calculate routes, and display locations in their own applications. Another example is the **Twitter API**, which enables third-party apps to access tweets, user profiles, and trends.
