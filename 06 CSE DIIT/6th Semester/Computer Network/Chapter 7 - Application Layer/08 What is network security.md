# What is Network Security?

**Network security** is a specialized field of cybersecurity that focuses on safeguarding computer networks and the data that flows across them from threats, attacks, and unauthorized access. It involves the design and implementation of policies, procedures, and technical measures to protect both the hardware and software components of a network.

The goal of network security is to ensure the **CIA triad** ‚Äî **Confidentiality (keeping data private), Integrity (keeping data accurate and unaltered), and Availability (keeping services accessible when needed).** By combining preventive, detective, and corrective measures, network security provides a safe environment for communication, data exchange, and business operations over private and public networks like the internet.

## Key Points About Network Security

1. **Protection Against Unauthorized Access**  
    Network security prevents intruders, hackers, and malicious software from gaining access to private data and resources.
    
2. **Ensures Data Confidentiality**  
    Sensitive information like passwords, financial details, and communications is kept secret through encryption and secure protocols.
    
3. **Maintains Data Integrity**  
    It ensures that information sent across the network is not altered or tampered with during transmission.
    
4. **Guarantees Availability of Services**  
    Network security prevents attacks such as **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)** that aim to disrupt services and make them unavailable to users.
    
5. **Involves Multiple Techniques**  
    Firewalls, intrusion detection systems, antivirus programs, VPNs, and strong authentication methods are some common tools used in network security.
