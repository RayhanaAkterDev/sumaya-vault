# What is Cryptography?

**Cryptography** is the science and practice of protecting information by converting it into a form that is unreadable to anyone except authorized users. It involves transforming plain text (readable data) into cipher text (encoded data) using mathematical algorithms, and then reversing the process back to plain text when needed. This process ensures that sensitive information remains private and secure during storage or transmission.

Cryptography has been used since ancient times for secret communication, but in modern computing it plays a critical role in securing online transactions, digital communications, and data storage. It forms the foundation of technologies such as encrypted messaging, secure banking, e-commerce, and digital signatures.

## Key Aspects of Cryptography

1. **Confidentiality**  
    Cryptography ensures that only authorized users can read the information. Data is encrypted into unreadable form so that outsiders cannot understand it.
    
2. **Integrity**  
    Cryptography guarantees that the message has not been altered during transmission. Even a small change in data is detected using hashing and digital signatures.
    
3. **Authentication**  
    Cryptography provides mechanisms to verify the identity of users or systems. This prevents impersonation and ensures trust in communication.
    
4. **Non-Repudiation**  
    Cryptographic techniques like digital signatures prevent a sender from denying that they sent a message. This is important in legal and financial transactions.
    
5. **Encryption and Decryption**  
    The core process of cryptography involves converting plain text into cipher text (encryption) and then back into plain text (decryption) using keys.
