**Packet Switching** is a method of communication in which data is divided into small units called **packets** before being transmitted. Each packet is sent independently through the network, and the path may vary depending on network conditions. At the destination, packets are reassembled to reconstruct the original message.

Packet switching is efficient for handling **bursty or irregular data**, as multiple users can share the same network resources simultaneously without a dedicated path. The Internet is a common example of a packet-switched network.

**Components Involved in Packet Switching:**

- **Data packets:** Units of data to be transmitted.    
- **Switching nodes/routers:** Devices that determine the best path for each packet.    
- **Reassembly mechanism:** Combines packets at the destination to reconstruct the original message.

**Key Features:**

1. No dedicated path is required.    
2. Supports multiple users efficiently.    
3. Can handle variable-length messages and irregular traffic.
