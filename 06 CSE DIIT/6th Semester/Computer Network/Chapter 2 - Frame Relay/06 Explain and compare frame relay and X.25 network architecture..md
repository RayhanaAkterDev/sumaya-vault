## Frame Relay Network

Frame Relay is a **high-speed, packet-switched WAN technology** designed for efficient data transfer over digital networks. It operates primarily at the **data link layer (Layer 2)** and uses **virtual circuits** to connect multiple devices. In Frame Relay networks, the **Data Terminal Equipment (DTE)**, such as computers or routers, communicates through **Data Circuit-terminating Equipment (DCE)** like Frame Relay switches, which forward the frames to their destination. Frame Relay minimizes overhead by **omitting per-packet error correction**, relying on the endpoints to handle errors, which makes it **fast and suitable for bursty traffic**.

## X.25 Network

X.25 is an **older packet-switched WAN technology** designed to provide **reliable communication over potentially noisy or unstable networks**. Unlike Frame Relay, X.25 operates across **physical, data link, and network layers (Layers 1–3)**. End devices (DTE) send data to packet switches (DCE), which handle **error detection, sequencing, and retransmission** to ensure data integrity. X.25 also uses **virtual circuits (PVC or SVC)** to establish connections, but its built-in error handling makes it **slower and more reliable**, suitable for long-distance or less stable links.
