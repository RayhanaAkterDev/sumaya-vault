# Define Intranet, Extranet, and Internet

An **intranet** is a private network used within an organization. It allows employees to securely share information, access company files, and communicate easily. Only people inside the company can use the intranet, making it a safe space for internal collaboration and resource sharing. This network helps improve efficiency by providing a centralized place for documents, announcements, and tools that employees need daily. Because it is private, sensitive information stays protected from outside access.

An **extranet** is like an extended intranet. It lets a company share certain information with people outside the organization, such as partners, suppliers, or clients. The extranet gives these external users limited and controlled access to specific parts of the company’s network, so they can collaborate without exposing everything. This controlled access is useful for sharing project updates, order information, or technical support while maintaining overall security. It strengthens business relationships by allowing smoother communication with trusted external parties.

The **internet** is a huge public network that connects computers all over the world. It allows anyone to access websites, send emails, use social media, and share information globally. Unlike intranet and extranet, the internet is open to everyone and doesn’t restrict access. It supports countless services like online shopping, video streaming, and global communication. Because it is public, users must be cautious about security and privacy when sharing information online.
