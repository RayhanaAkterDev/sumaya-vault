## Definition of IoT

The **Internet of Things (IoT)** is a system of interconnected physical devices, vehicles, appliances, and other everyday objects that are embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity. These devices can collect and exchange data over the internet or other communication networks. IoT enables these objects to be monitored, controlled, and managed remotely, often without requiring direct human interaction.

By connecting these "things" to the internet, IoT allows for real-time data gathering, automation, and intelligent decision-making. This leads to increased efficiency, improved user experiences, and the creation of smart environmentsâ€”such as smart homes, smart cities, industrial automation, healthcare monitoring, and more.

For example, IoT devices can include smart thermostats that adjust temperature based on occupancy, wearable fitness trackers that monitor health metrics, connected cars that provide real-time traffic updates, or industrial sensors that predict equipment failures before they happen.
