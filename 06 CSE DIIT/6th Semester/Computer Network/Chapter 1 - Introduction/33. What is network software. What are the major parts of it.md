### **Network Software**

Network software is a set of programs and tools that manage and control computer networks. It allows computers and devices to communicate, share resources, and exchange data efficiently. This software ensures smooth network operation, provides security, and supports applications such as email, file sharing, and internet access. It also monitors network performance, manages traffic, and protects against unauthorized access or security threats, enabling reliable and efficient communication across the network.

### **Major Parts of Network Software**

1. **Network Operating System (NOS)**  
    The network operating system manages network resources, controls data flow, and allows multiple devices to communicate. It provides services like file and printer sharing, user management, and network security. Examples include Windows Server, Linux-based NOS, and Novell NetWare.
    
2. **Network Management Software**  
    This part monitors and manages the networkâ€™s performance, identifies problems, and helps in troubleshooting. It ensures the network is running efficiently and can include tools for configuration, fault management, and traffic analysis.
    
3. **Communication Protocols**  
    Protocols define the rules for data exchange between devices. They ensure proper formatting, error checking, and reliable delivery of messages. Common protocols include TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.
    
4. **Network Security Software**  
    Security software protects the network from unauthorized access, malware, and data breaches. It includes firewalls, antivirus programs, intrusion detection systems, and encryption tools to safeguard communication and resources.
    
5. **Application Software**  
    These are programs that use the network to provide services to users, such as email clients, messaging apps, video conferencing tools, and file-sharing applications. They rely on the network infrastructure to function effectively.
