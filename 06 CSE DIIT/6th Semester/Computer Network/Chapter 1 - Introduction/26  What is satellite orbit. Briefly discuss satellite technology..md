## Satellite Orbit

A **satellite orbit** is the curved path along which a satellite moves around the Earth or another celestial body under the influence of gravity. A satellite remains in orbit because its **forward velocity** balances the **gravitational pull** of the planet. The type of orbit chosen depends on the satelliteâ€™s **altitude** and **mission purpose**, ensuring it can operate effectively.

Common types of satellite orbits include:

- **Low Earth Orbit (LEO):** 160â€“2,000 km above Earth. LEO satellites are commonly used for **communication, imaging, and research**, as their proximity allows high-resolution data collection.
    
- **Medium Earth Orbit (MEO):** 2,000â€“35,786 km above Earth. MEO satellites are mainly used for **navigation systems** like GPS, providing a balance between coverage and signal strength.
    
- **Geostationary Orbit (GEO):** About 35,786 km above the equator. Satellites stay **fixed relative to Earth**, useful for **weather monitoring, TV broadcasting, and communications**.
    
- **Polar Orbit:** Moves over the **Earthâ€™s poles**, covering the **whole planet** over time. Used for **Earth observation, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing**.

## Satellite Technology

**Satellite technology** refers to the design, development, launching, and operation of artificial satellites. It involves a combination of systems and equipment that enable satellites to perform their intended functions effectively.

_Key components of satellite technology include:_

- **Communication systems:** Transmit and receive signals between Earth stations and satellites for applications such as TV broadcasting, internet, radio, and telephony.
    
- **Power systems:** Typically consist of solar panels and rechargeable batteries to provide continuous energy for satellite operation.
    
- **Propulsion and control systems:** Maintain the satelliteâ€™s orbit and orientation, ensuring it stays on course and performs maneuvers when needed.
    
- **Sensors and payloads:** Instruments carried on the satellite according to its mission, such as cameras, weather sensors, scientific instruments, or transponders.
    
- **Ground control stations:** Monitor, manage, and control satellite operations from Earth.
    

*Applications of satellite technology:*

- **Communication:** Enables global telecommunication services, including satellite TV, radio, and internet.
    
- **Navigation:** Provides accurate positioning and timing through systems like GPS and GLONASS.
    
- **Remote sensing:** Monitors weather patterns, natural disasters, environmental changes, and land use.
    
- **Scientific research and defense:** Supports space exploration, astronomical observations, military surveillance, and national security.
