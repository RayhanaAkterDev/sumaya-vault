## Classification of Network according to Distance

**Computer network** fall into **three** classes regarding the size, distance, and the structure namely:

### LAN (Local Area Network)

A **LAN** is a network that connects computers and devices within a **small and limited area**, such as a home, school, office, or college. It allows users to share files, software, printers, scanners, and internet connections quickly and easily. Devices in a LAN are connected using **one or more switches**, and communication happens through **private IP addresses** as defined in the TCP/IP protocol. A **router** is used to connect the LAN to a larger network like a WAN or the internet.

LANs are usually owned and managed by a single person or organization, and they are fast, cost-effective, and easy to maintain within a limited space.

### MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)

A **MAN** connects multiple LANs across a **city, town, or large campus**. It covers a bigger area than a LAN but is smaller than a WAN. MANs are useful for connecting different buildings of the same company, university, or institution located in different parts of the same city.

MANs often use **high-speed connections** such as **fiber optics** and are usually managed by a single organization or an Internet Service Provider (ISP). Technologies like Metro Ethernet, ATM, or fiber-based systems are commonly used. MAN works as a bridge between LAN and WAN. It also helps connect local networks to the internet or other remote services using a strong and fast backbone.

### WAN (Wide Area Network)

A **WAN** is a large network that connects computers and smaller networks like LANs and MANs over **very long distances**, such as between cities, countries, or even continents.

WANs use different types of communication links like telephone lines, radio waves, fiber cables, and satellites. They are often built and maintained by governments, large corporations, or service providers, and they require expensive equipment and high-speed technology to handle data over long distances. The **internet** is the most common and largest example of a WAN. WANs help organizations and people stay connected globally and enable data sharing, online services, and remote communication.
