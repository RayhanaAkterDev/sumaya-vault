# Network Interface Card (NIC)

A **Network Interface Card (NIC)** is a hardware component installed in a computer or network device that enables it to **connect to a network and communicate with other devices**. It serves as the **interface between the deviceâ€™s internal bus (like PCI/PCIe) and the network medium** (copper cables, optical fiber, or wireless). The NIC manages the **physical and data link layer functions**, including data transmission, reception, error detection, and addressing through a unique **MAC (Media Access Control) address**. Modern NICs may also provide features such as **offloading network processing tasks from the CPU, supporting high-speed connections, and enabling virtualization for multiple virtual network interfaces**.

The NIC converts data from the computer into signals suitable for the network, recognizes incoming network signals, and ensures proper delivery to the operating system. It also facilitates communication protocols and maintains data integrity during transmission.

**Example:**  
A desktop connected to a LAN uses a NIC to transmit and receive data packets to and from other computers and servers, enabling tasks like file sharing, printing, and internet access.
