# IP Address

An **Internet Protocol (IP) address** is a structured numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two essential roles: first, as a **unique identifier** for the device (like a roll number for a student), and second, as a **locator** that specifies where the device is situated within the network. An IP address is embedded into every data packet, where the **source IP** indicates the senderâ€™s address and the **destination IP** indicates the receiverâ€™s address. This allows routers and switches to forward the packet correctly across local networks and the Internet. In short, the IP address acts like the digital address of a device, ensuring accurate identification and delivery of data between millions of interconnected systems worldwide.

**Example**

- **IPv4 example:** `192.168.1.10` â€“ typically used in home and office LANs.    
- **IPv6 example:** `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334` â€“ designed for modern networks with far more devices.

### Key Characteristics of IP Addresses

1. **Uniqueness** â€“ Each device in a network must have a distinct IP address to avoid confusion and ensure data is delivered to the right destination.
    
2. **Hierarchical structure** â€“ IP addresses are divided into a network portion and a host portion, which allows easy identification of both the network and the specific device.
    
3. **Two versions** â€“ IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses written in dotted-decimal format, while IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses written in hexadecimal format separated by colons.
    
4. **Types of usage** â€“ IP addresses can be public (used globally on the Internet) or private (used within local networks such as homes, offices, or organizations).
    
5. **Formats** â€“ IPv4 looks like `192.168.1.1` (four octets), whereas IPv6 looks like `fe80::1ff:fe23:4567:890a` (eight groups of hexadecimal).
    
6. **Assignment method** â€“ They can be static (manually configured and fixed) or dynamic (automatically assigned by DHCP servers for temporary use).
    
7. **Fundamental for routing** â€“ Routers depend on IP addresses to determine the correct path for data packets across networks, making them the backbone of Internet communication.
