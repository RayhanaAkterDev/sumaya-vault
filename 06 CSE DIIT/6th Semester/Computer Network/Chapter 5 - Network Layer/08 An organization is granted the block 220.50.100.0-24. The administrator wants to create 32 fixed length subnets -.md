An organization is granted the block 220.50.100.0/24. The administrator wants to create 32 fixed length subnets -
- Find the subnet mask.
- Find the number of addresses in each subnet.
- Find the first and last addresses in subnet 1.
- Find the first and last addresses in subnet 32.

---

### Given:

- Network: `220.50.100.0/24`    
- Required subnets: 32

### 1. Find the subnet mask

**Number of bits needed for 32 subnets:**

Add these bits to the original network prefix (/24).
`24+5=29`

âœ… **Subnet mask:** `/29` or in decimal `255.255.255.248`

---

### 2. Number of addresses in each subnet
Number of addresses = ![[Pasted image 20250909072032.png]]

Usable addresses: `8 âˆ’ 2 = 6`

---

### 3. Find the first and last addresses in subnet 1

- First address in subnet 1 is `220.50.100.0`
- Last address in subnet 1 is `220.50.100.7`
  - ---
- First usable address: `220.50.100.1`    
- Last usable address: `220.50.100.6`

---

**Step 1:** Calculate the starting address of subnet 32:

Network address of subnet 32: 

![[Pasted image 20250909074803.png]]  

- First address in subnet 32 is `220.50.100.248`
- Last address in subnet 32 is `220.50.100.255`
  - ---
- First usable address: `220.50.100.249`    
- Last usable address: `220.50.100.254`
