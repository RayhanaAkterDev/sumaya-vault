### Network Connecting Devices

Network connecting devices are hardware components that **link computers, servers, and other devices** to form a network. They enable **communication, resource sharing, and data exchange** between devices and can operate at different layers of the **OSI model**, depending on their function. These devices are essential for both small and large networks, including LANs, WANs, and the Internet.

### Types of Network Connecting Devices

- **Hub:** A hub is a simple network device that connects multiple devices in a network. It broadcasts incoming data to all connected devices without filtering. It operates at Layer 1 (Physical Layer) and is suitable for small networks but can cause network congestion. Example: Connecting a few computers in a small office LAN.
    
- **Switch:** A switch connects multiple devices and forwards data only to the intended recipient using MAC addresses. It operates at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) and reduces network congestion compared to a hub. Example: Connecting computers and printers in an office LAN.
    
- **Router:** A router connects different networks and directs data packets between them based on IP addresses. It operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer) and is used to connect LANs to the Internet. Example: Home or enterprise networks connecting to the Internet.
    
- **Gateway:** A gateway connects networks using different protocols and can perform protocol conversion if needed. It operates at Layer 4 or higher and is used to connect networks with different architectures. Example: Connecting a companyâ€™s LAN to a legacy system or another network type.
    
- **Modem:** A modem converts digital signals to analog (modulation) and analog signals to digital (demodulation) for transmission over telephone or cable lines. It is used for Internet access over DSL or cable networks. Example: DSL modem connecting a home computer to the Internet.
    
- **Access Point (AP):** An access point provides wireless connectivity to devices and connects them to a wired network. It is used to extend Wi-Fi coverage in homes, offices, or public spaces. Example: Office Wi-Fi network allowing laptops and smartphones to connect.
