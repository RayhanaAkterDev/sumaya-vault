# Quality of Service (QoS) in Multimedia Networks

**Quality of Service (QoS)** in multimedia networks refers to the **mechanisms and techniques used to ensure that network traffic meets specific performance requirements** such as bandwidth, delay, jitter, and packet loss. QoS is especially important for **real-time applications** like video streaming, VoIP, and online gaming, where poor network performance can significantly degrade user experience. QoS prioritizes critical multimedia traffic over less time-sensitive data, **manages network congestion**, and **allocates resources** to meet application-specific requirements. It ensures **smooth and reliable transmission** by controlling latency, minimizing jitter, and reducing packet loss.

**Example:**  
In a video conferencing system, QoS ensures that voice and video packets are given higher priority over file downloads or emails, maintaining clear audio and smooth video without interruption.
