The **Spiral Model** is a **risk-driven** software process model that combines features of both **iterative development** and the **Waterfall model**. It organizes the development process into a series of spiral-shaped loops or phases, each consisting of four main activities: planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation.

Each loop represents one phase of the software development lifecycle and leads to a more refined version of the system. The key characteristic of this model is early identification and mitigation of risks through repeated refinement and feedback. It is best suited for large, complex, and high-risk projects where requirements may evolve over time.

## üìç Four Phases of Each Spiral Loop

Proposed by **Barry Boehm in 1986**, this model enhances the basic spiral concept by integrating **design**, **prototyping**, and **risk management** in a structured, iterative process. 

Below is a brief overview of the four phases that occur in each loop of Boehm's Spiral Model.

1. **Planning Phase:**  
    This phase focuses on understanding user requirements, defining system objectives, and exploring possible development strategies. It sets a clear direction for the next phases.
    
2. **Risk Analysis Phase:**  
    Unique to the Spiral Model, this phase identifies potential project risks and uncertainties. The team evaluates alternatives and may develop prototypes to reduce or eliminate risks early.
    
3. **Engineering Phase:**  
    This is where actual design, coding, and testing occur. The goal is to develop the system incrementally based on feedback and previous decisions.
    
4. **Evaluation Phase:**  
    The partial product is reviewed by the customer for feedback. The team assesses whether the phase goals were met and plans improvements or changes for the next spiral.

## ‚úÖ Merits of Spiral Model

- **Best Model to Handle Risky Projects:** It focuses on identifying and managing risks early in each cycle.
- **Good Choice for Large Projects:** Suitable for complex systems that require careful planning and risk control.
- **Flexible with Requirements:** Supports evolving requirements through iterative development.
- **Better Customer Satisfaction:** Continuous customer involvement ensures the product meets user needs.
- **Iterative and Incremental Approach:** Allows gradual refinement of the system with each cycle.
- **Open to Receiving Any Feedback:** Feedback is incorporated at every iteration to improve the product.
- **Better Quality:** Early risk management and iterative testing enhance overall software quality.
- **Better Planning and Monitoring:** Each cycle begins with detailed planning, improving project control.

## ‚ùå Demerits of Spiral Model

- **Complex and Costly**: The model can be expensive and difficult to manage for smaller projects due to its complexity.
- **Requires Expertise**: Effective risk analysis needs skilled and experienced professionals.
- **Not Suitable for Low-Risk or Small Projects**: The overhead of risk management may be unnecessary for simple or well-defined systems.
- **Time-Consuming**: Multiple iterations can lead to longer development timelines compared to linear models.

# New version of Spiral Model

## Spiral Model

The Spiral Model is a **risk-driven software development process** that combines the systematic approach of the **Waterfall model** with the flexibility of **iterative development** proposed by **Barry Boehm** in 1986., It integrates **design**, **prototyping**, and **risk management** in an iterative process. The development is visualized as a spiral, where each loop represents a phase of the lifecycle, consisting of **four key activities** that are repeated until the final system is completed.

- **Planning Phase:**  
	This phase focuses on understanding the objectives, gathering requirements, and selecting suitable strategies. It sets a clear path for the upcoming development activities.

- **Risk Analysis Phase:**  
	Unique to the Spiral Model, this phase emphasizes identifying possible risks and uncertainties. Different alternatives are considered, and prototypes may be built to reduce or eliminate critical risks early.

- **Engineering Phase:**  
	Here, actual development takes place through design, coding, and testing. The product is built in increments, with each cycle producing a progressively improved version of the system.

- **Evaluation Phase:**  
	The developed part of the system is reviewed by the customer to gather feedback. Based on this feedback, necessary modifications are planned for the next spiral, ensuring alignment with user needs.
