# 🌼 Feasibility study of software development

A **feasibility study** is done before starting the actual development of a software project. It helps to decide whether the project is **possible**, **practical**, and **worth doing**. The main need for a feasibility study is to **avoid wasting time, money, and resources** on a project that may not succeed. It checks whether the software can be developed within the **given time**, **budget**, and with the **available technology**. It also studies whether the system will be **useful for the users** and whether it will solve the real problem.

**📌 Following Are the Key Points:**

- Helps to know if the project is practical.    
- Saves time and cost by avoiding failed projects.    
- Identifies risks and possible problems early.    
- Checks technical, financial, and user-related factors.    
- Supports better planning and decision-making.

In short, a feasibility study helps to understand the **risks, costs, and benefits** before making a final decision to develop the software.
