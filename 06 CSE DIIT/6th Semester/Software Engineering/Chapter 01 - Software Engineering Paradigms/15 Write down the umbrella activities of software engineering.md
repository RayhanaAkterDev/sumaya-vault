# ✨Umbrella Activities of Software Engineering

Umbrella activities in software engineering support the main development processes and ensure that the project is completed successfully. These activities are ongoing throughout the software development lifecycle and help maintain project quality, control, and progress.
 
The activities of umbrella activities are discussed below:

1. **Software Project Tracking and Control**  
    This activity involves monitoring and managing the progress of the software project to ensure it stays on schedule, within budget, and meets goals. It includes tracking milestones, progress reports, and making necessary adjustments to the plan.
    

---

2. **Risk Management**  
    Risk management focuses on identifying, analyzing, and minimizing potential risks that may affect the project's success. Proactively handling risks helps prevent serious issues and ensures smoother project execution.
    

---

3. **Software Quality Assurance (SQA)**  
    SQA includes processes and activities to ensure the software meets defined quality standards. It involves planning and conducting reviews, audits, and testing to ensure the product is reliable, secure, and functions as expected.
    

---

4. **Technical Reviews**  
    Structured reviews of software artifacts like design, documents and source code are conducted to detect defects early. These reviews involve team members assessing quality and conformance to requirements.
    

---

5. **Software Configuration Management**  
    This activity tracks and controls changes in the software and related documents. It ensures version control, traceability, and consistency, helping to manage updates and avoid conflicts in the project.
    

---

6. **Document Preparation and Production**  
    Creating and maintaining clear, complete documentation is essential. This includes documenting requirements, design decisions, source code, and test results to support future maintenance and understanding of the software.
    

---

7. **Reusability Management**  
    This activity promotes the use and creation of reusable software components. By reusing tested and proven modules, development time and cost are reduced, and software quality improves.
    

---

8. **Measurement and Metrics**  
    It involves collecting and analyzing quantitative data related to software and its development process. Metrics like defect rates, code complexity, and test coverage help monitor performance and guide improvements.
