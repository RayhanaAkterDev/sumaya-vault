## The process maturity levels of SEI's CMM

The **Software Engineering Institute (SEI)** introduced the **Capability Maturity Model (CMM)** to assess and improve the maturity of software development processes in organizations. The model defines **five maturity levels**, where each level represents a specific state of process capability and improvement.
 
**Process maturity levels of SEI's CMM**:

1. **Level 1 – Initial**: At this stage, processes are **ad hoc and chaotic**. software processes are unpredictable, poorly controlled, and reactive. There is no formal planning or defined process structure. Success heavily depends on individual effort and heroics, not on repeatable procedures. Projects often suffer from missed deadlines, cost overruns, and quality issues.
 
2. **Level 2 – Repeatable**: Basic project management practices are introduced. The organization starts to establish discipline in tracking cost, schedule, and functionality. Successful practices from previous projects are repeated in similar new projects. However, these practices are not yet standardized across the whole organization.

3. **Level 3 – Defined**: At this stage, all processes are clearly defined, documented, and standardized across the organization. There is a well-established process framework that is followed by all teams. Roles and responsibilities are clearly assigned, and there is an emphasis on training and process consistency. Tailoring guidelines may be used to adapt processes for specific needs.

4. **Level 4 – Managed**: Processes are now measured and controlled using quantitative data. The organization uses metrics to understand and control both software process and product quality. Performance becomes predictable and consistent, and project outcomes can be forecasted with reasonable accuracy.

5. **Level 5 – Optimizing**: This is the highest level of maturity, where the focus is on continuous process improvement. The organization proactively identifies weaknesses and adapts processes using quantitative feedback, innovation, and advanced tools. The goal is to prevent defects, reduce waste, and improve efficiency and quality over time.
