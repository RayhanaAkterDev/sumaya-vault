# üåº RAD software process mode

**Rapid Application Development (RAD)** is a software process model that focuses on **fast development and quick delivery** of software. It is based on **prototyping and iterative development**, where different parts of the software are built and improved step by step.

Unlike traditional models with strict planning, RAD allows planning, coding, and testing to happen together. **User requirements are gathered through workshops or focus groups**, and quick prototypes are created and shown to users. Based on feedback, the product is updated in short cycles.

RAD often **reuses existing components** to save time and effort. Small teams work closely with users to ensure the final product meets their needs. Because of its speed and flexibility, RAD is ideal for projects that need **quick delivery and strong user involvement**.

### üîÑ **Phases of RAD Model**

1. **Business Modelling:**  
    Identifies and analyzes how information flows across business functions and defines what data is important, how it‚Äôs used, and what drives successful operations.

2. **Data Modelling:**  
    Structures and organizes data collected during business modelling. Defines key data objects, their attributes, and the relationships between them.

3. **Process Modelling:**  
    Translates data models into workflows that achieve business objectives. Describes processes like adding, deleting, or updating data to fulfill business needs.

4. **Application Generation:**  
    Uses automation tools to convert process and data models into working prototypes. Actual coding is done at this stage with minimal manual effort.

5. **Testing and Turnover:**  
    Since components are tested during each iteration, overall testing time is reduced. Final testing ensures proper integration of all modules with full data flow and interface validation.
