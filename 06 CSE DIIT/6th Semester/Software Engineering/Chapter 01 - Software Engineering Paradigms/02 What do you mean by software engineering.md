## Software Engineering

**Software engineering** is an engineering discipline that deals with all aspects of software creation, starting from the initial specification of requirements and continuing through design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance after the software is in use. It applies structured and methodical approaches to build software that is reliable, efficient, and meets user needs.

This discipline covers the entire software lifecycle, ensuring that software is planned, developed, and maintained in a way that reduces errors and improves quality. Software engineering also involves managing projects, controlling risks, and using best practices to deliver software on time and within budget.
