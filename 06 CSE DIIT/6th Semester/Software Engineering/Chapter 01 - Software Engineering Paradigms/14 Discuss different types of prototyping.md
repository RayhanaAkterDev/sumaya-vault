# üåºDifferent types of prototyping

Prototyping is a key approach in software development where early versions of a system or its components are built to understand requirements, test functionalities, and gather user feedback. Based on the purpose and nature of the project, different types of prototyping methods are used. These are discussed below:
 
1. **Throwaway Prototyping (Rapid Prototyping)**: Also known as rapid prototyping, this method involves creating a quick model to understand unclear or incomplete requirements. The prototype is used mainly for demonstration and feedback, after which it is discarded. The final system is developed separately from scratch. This type helps reduce early misunderstandings but does not reuse any code or design from the prototype.

2. **Evolutionary Prototyping:**  
    In this method, the prototype is not discarded. Instead, it is continuously refined based on user feedback until it becomes the final product. This approach is useful when requirements are expected to evolve over time. It ensures better alignment with user needs but may lead to complexity in managing changes and maintaining system quality.
    
3. **Incremental Prototyping:**  
    Here, the system is divided into smaller modules. Individual prototypes are built for each module and later integrated to form the complete system. This approach allows parallel development, easier testing, and faster delivery of parts of the system. However, integration of modules can be challenging and may require careful planning.
    
4. **Extreme Prototyping:**  
    Extreme prototyping is mainly used in web application development. It consists of three phases:
    
- **Phase 1:** Create a static HTML mockup to represent the user interface.    
- **Phase 2:** Add simulated functionality to show system behavior using dummy data.    
- **Phase 3:** Integrate the actual backend to make the application fully functional.  
  
	It emphasizes rapid development of the user interface and quick feedback. This structured method ensures early validation of UI and interaction before backend development begins.
