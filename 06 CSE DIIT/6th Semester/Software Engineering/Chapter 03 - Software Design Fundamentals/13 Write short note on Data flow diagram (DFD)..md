### **Data Flow Diagram (DFD) ‚Äì Short Note**

- **Definition:**  
    A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation that illustrates how **data moves through a system**. It shows the interaction between **processes, data stores, and external entities**, making it easier to understand the system‚Äôs operations. DFDs are widely used in **software engineering** during **system analysis and design** to model information flow. There are different levels of DFDs: **Context Diagram (Level 0)** shows the system as a single process interacting with external entities, while **Level 1 and beyond** break the system into sub-processes for detailed analysis.

- **Purpose:**
    
    - To visualize the flow of data within a system.        
    - To understand how inputs are transformed into outputs.        
    - To identify inefficiencies, redundancies, or bottlenecks in processes.

- **Key Components:**
    
    1. **Process:** Represents activities or operations that transform incoming data into output.        
    2. **Data Flow:** Arrows indicating the direction of data movement between processes, stores, and entities.        
    3. **Data Store:** Places where data is kept for future use or reference.        
    4. **External Entity:** Sources or destinations of data that exist outside the system.

- **Advantages:**
    
    - Simple and easy to understand for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.        
    - Assists in system analysis and design by clearly showing data flow.        
    - Helps identify dependencies, redundancies, and areas for improvement.
