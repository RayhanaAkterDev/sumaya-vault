### Guidelines for a Good Software Design

1. **Avoid Tunnel Vision**  
    Designers should consider the system as a whole and avoid focusing too narrowly on a single module or feature. This ensures the design supports overall system objectives and integrates well.
    
2. **Reuse Existing Solutions**  
    The design should make use of proven solutions, libraries, or components instead of creating everything from scratch. This saves time, reduces errors, and increases reliability.
    
3. **Traceable to Analysis Model**  
    Every design element should clearly map to requirements and analysis artifacts. Traceability ensures that the system meets its intended purpose and avoids unnecessary features.
    
4. **Minimize Intellectual Distance**  
    The design should be easy to understand and closely aligned with the problem domain. Reducing the gap between the problem and the design makes implementation and maintenance simpler.
    
5. **Maintain Uniformity and Integration**  
    The system should be consistent in style, naming, and module interaction. A uniform and well-integrated design improves readability and makes components work together smoothly.
    
6. **Accommodate Change**  
    The design must be flexible to adapt to future requirements or modifications. A design that can easily evolve reduces the cost and effort of maintenance.
    
7. **Graceful Degradation**  
    The system should handle errors or failures in a controlled manner without complete breakdown. This ensures reliability and a better user experience.
    
8. **Assess for Quality**  
    Designs should be evaluated against quality criteria such as efficiency, maintainability, usability, and scalability. Quality assessment ensures the system will meet expected standards.
    
9. **Review to Discover Errors**  
    Regular design reviews and inspections help detect mistakes early, preventing costly changes during implementation.
    
10. **Separate Design from Coding**  
    Design is planning and structuring the system, while coding is implementation. A good design guides coding but is distinct from it; mixing the two can reduce clarity and quality.
