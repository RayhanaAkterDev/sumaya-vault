|Feature|Object-Oriented Design (OOD)|Function-Oriented Design (FOD)|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|Focuses on **objects**, which encapsulate **data and behavior** together.|Focuses on **functions** (procedures) and the sequence of operations on data.|
|**Approach**|**Data-driven approach:** Data and operations are bundled into objects.|**Process-driven approach:** Data and functions are separate; design follows functional decomposition.|
|**Basic Unit**|Object or class is the basic building block.|Function or procedure is the basic building block.|
|**Data Handling**|Data is **encapsulated** within objects; access through methods.|Data is often **global or passed explicitly** between functions.|
|**Abstraction**|Supports abstraction through **classes and inheritance**.|Supports abstraction through **functional decomposition**.|
|**Reusability**|High; objects and classes can be reused across programs.|Moderate; functions can be reused, but integration depends on data structures.|
|**Modularity**|Modules are **self-contained objects**, easier to maintain and extend.|Modules are **collections of functions**, sometimes tightly coupled with data.|
|**Maintenance**|Easier to maintain due to encapsulation and inheritance.|Maintenance can be harder if data structures change frequently.|
|**Example Languages**|Java, C++, Python (OO features).|C, Pascal, Fortran.|
