### **Criteria for Effective Modular Design**

Effective modular design ensures that a software system is **easy to understand, maintain, and extend**, while minimizing complexity and interdependencies. Several criteria are commonly used to evaluate the quality of modular design:

1. **High Cohesion**  
    Cohesion refers to how closely related the responsibilities and functionalities of a single module are. A highly cohesive module focuses on a single task or closely related tasks, making it easier to understand, maintain, and test. High cohesion reduces complexity within modules and improves code readability.
    
2. **Low Coupling**  
    Coupling measures the degree of dependency between different modules. Effective modular design aims for low coupling so that changes in one module have minimal impact on others. Low coupling increases system flexibility, simplifies debugging, and allows modules to be reused in different contexts.
    
3. **Well-Defined Interfaces**  
    Each module should have a clear, well-defined interface specifying how it communicates with other modules. This includes the data inputs, outputs, and methods of interaction. Well-defined interfaces reduce misunderstandings and make module integration smoother.
    
4. **Information Hiding**  
    Modules should hide their internal implementation details and expose only what is necessary through interfaces. Information hiding protects the system from unintended interference, makes modules easier to change internally without affecting others, and enhances reliability.
    
5. **Reusability**  
    Modules should be designed so that they can be reused in other programs or parts of the system. Reusable modules save development time, ensure consistency, and improve overall system efficiency.
    
6. **Maintainability**  
    Modules should be structured so that updates, bug fixes, or enhancements can be implemented easily. Maintainable modules reduce long-term development costs and ensure that the system remains reliable over time.
    
7. **Simplicity**  
    Each module should be as simple as possible, performing a specific function without unnecessary complexity. Simple modules are easier to develop, test, and debug, and reduce the likelihood of introducing errors.
    
8. **Scalability and Flexibility**  
    Modules should allow for future growth or changes in requirements without major redesign. Flexible modules enable easy adaptation to new features or expanded functionality, supporting the long-term evolution of the system.
