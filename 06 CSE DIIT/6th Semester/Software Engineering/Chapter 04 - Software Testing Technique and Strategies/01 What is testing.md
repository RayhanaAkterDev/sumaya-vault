**Testing** in software engineering is the process of **evaluating and verifying a software application** to ensure that it **meets the specified requirements** and **functions as intended**. Its main purpose is to **identify defects or errors**, improve the **quality, reliability, and performance** of the software, and ensure it behaves correctly under **different conditions**.

Testing is performed at various levels: **unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing**, and can be carried out using **manual methods or automated tools**. It is an essential part of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** to reduce **bugs, failures, and maintenance costs**.


Errors can be detected through two main approaches:
- **White Box Testing** ‚Äì Tests the internal structure, logic, and code of the software.    
- **Black Box Testing** ‚Äì Tests the functionality of the software without knowing its internal code.
