## Debugging Techniques

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in a program. Several techniques are commonly used to identify and correct defects efficiently:

1. **Print or Trace Debugging** ‚Äì Involves inserting statements in the program to display variable values, program flow, or intermediate results. This helps the programmer trace where the code is deviating from expected behavior and identify logical errors.
    
2. **Interactive Debugging** ‚Äì Using a debugger tool, the program can be executed step by step, with breakpoints set to pause execution at specific points. Programmers can inspect variable values, memory, and program flow to locate the exact cause of an error.
    
3. **Backtracking** ‚Äì The programmer starts from where the error is detected and works backward through the program to find its source. This method is useful for errors that appear far from where they originated, especially in large programs.
    
4. **Cause-Elimination (Error Hypothesis)** ‚Äì The programmer forms hypotheses about possible causes of an error and tests them systematically. By confirming the actual cause, the programmer can apply the correct fix efficiently, avoiding random trial-and-error.
    
5. **Automated Debugging Tools** ‚Äì Modern IDEs provide automated features like syntax checkers, code analyzers, and memory or runtime error detectors. These tools help quickly identify errors such as null references, memory leaks, or logic flaws.
    
6. **Unit Testing and Test-Driven Debugging** ‚Äì Small test cases are written for individual modules to detect defects early. In test-driven development (TDD), tests are created before coding, ensuring errors are caught immediately during development.
    
7. **Logging** ‚Äì Programs maintain logs of execution steps, errors, or warnings. Analyzing these logs helps locate problems without stepping through the code, especially in large or deployed systems.
