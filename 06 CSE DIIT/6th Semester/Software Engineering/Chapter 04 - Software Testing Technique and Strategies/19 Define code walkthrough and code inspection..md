### **1. Code Walkthrough**

**Definition:**  
A **code walkthrough** is a **peer review technique** in software engineering where the **author of the code presents the program to a group of reviewers**. The author explains the **logic, flow, design decisions, and implementation details** of the code line by line or module by module. The main purpose is to **detect errors, suggest improvements, and share knowledge** among team members before formal testing. Walkthroughs are typically **informal, collaborative, and educational**, allowing team members to discuss potential problems and clarify design intentions.

**Key Points:**

1. Conducted **informally**, usually in meetings led by the code author.    
2. Reviewers **ask questions, provide suggestions, and discuss alternatives**.    
3. Helps in **early detection of defects** that may not be obvious during testing.    
4. Encourages **knowledge sharing and team collaboration**.    
5. Focuses on **code logic, design, readability, and maintainability** rather than strict adherence to standards.

### **2. Code Inspection**

**Definition:**  
A **code inspection** is a **formal, systematic, and structured review process** in which a team of reviewers examines the source code in detail to **identify defects, logical errors, deviations from coding standards, and potential performance issues**. Unlike a walkthrough, inspections follow a **predefined procedure, use checklists, and produce formal documentation**. The primary objective is to **improve software quality, reduce maintenance costs, and catch defects early in the development lifecycle**. Inspections are considered one of the most effective techniques for **preventive defect detection**.

**Key Points:**

1. Conducted **formally** with roles such as moderator, reader, recorder, and reviewers.    
2. Uses **checklists and predefined criteria** to ensure thorough evaluation.    
3. Focuses on **detecting defects, improving quality, and ensuring standard compliance**.    
4. Produces **formal reports** documenting identified issues for corrective action.    
5. Helps reduce **post-release defects** and lowers the overall cost of software maintenance.
