## Distinction Between White Box Testing and Black Box Testing


|Feature|White Box Testing|Black Box Testing|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|Testing technique where the **internal code, logic, and structure** of the software are known and tested.|Testing technique where the **internal code is not known**, and testing is based only on inputs and expected outputs.|
|**Also Called**|Glass-box or structural testing|Behavioral or functional testing|
|**Knowledge Required**|Requires **complete knowledge of the program‚Äôs code**|Does **not require knowledge of the code**|
|**Focus**|Focuses on **internal logic, code paths, conditions, and branches**|Focuses on **functionality, behavior, and outputs**|
|**Test Basis**|Test cases are derived from **code and design documents**|Test cases are derived from **requirements and specifications**|
|**Conducted By**|Typically performed by **developers**|Typically performed by **testers or QA engineers**|
|**Level of Testing**|Mainly used in **unit testing and integration testing**|Mainly used in **system testing, acceptance testing, and regression testing**|
|**Advantages**|Detects **logical errors, redundant code, and unreachable paths**|Detects **missing functionalities, incorrect outputs, and requirement mismatches**|
|**Limitations**|Cannot test unimplemented requirements or user interactions|Cannot detect internal code errors or optimize code coverage|
|**Example**|Testing a loop, branch, or conditional in code|Testing a login form by entering valid and invalid credentials|
