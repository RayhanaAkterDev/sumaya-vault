### **Integration Testing**

Integration testing is a level of software testing in which **individual modules or components of a system are combined and tested together** to ensure they **work correctly as a group**. The main objectives are to **verify the interaction between modules, validate data and control flow across interfaces, detect interface defects, and ensure that modules integrate according to design specifications**. Integration testing helps uncover issues that unit testing alone cannot detect, ensuring smooth collaboration between different parts of the software.

**Key Features:**

1. Performed **after unit testing** and before system testing.    
2. Can be **incremental** (modules added one by one) or **non-incremental** (all modules tested together).    
3. Focuses on **module interactions rather than individual module functionality**.    
4. Supports **top-down, bottom-up, or hybrid (sandwich) testing approaches**.    
5. Helps in **validating data exchange, control flow, and interface contracts** between modules.    

**Advantages:**

1. Detects **interface and interaction defects** early, reducing later rework.    
2. Ensures **modules work together as intended**, improving system reliability.    
3. Reduces risk of **integration failures in the final system**.    
4. Provides **better understanding of module dependencies and system design**.    
5. Supports **incremental testing**, allowing partial system validation during development.
