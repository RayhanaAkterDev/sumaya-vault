## Distinction Between Verification and Validation

|Feature|Verification|Validation|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|The process of checking whether the software is being **built correctly according to specifications, design, and standards**.|The process of checking whether the software **meets the actual user requirements and expectations**.|
|**Purpose / Question Addressed**|Answers the question: _‚ÄúAre we building the product right?‚Äù_|Answers the question: _‚ÄúAre we building the right product?‚Äù_|
|**Focus**|Focuses on **processes, design documents, code, and standards compliance**.|Focuses on **software functionality, behavior, and user satisfaction**.|
|**Performed By**|Typically performed by **developers, QA engineers, or testers** during development.|Typically performed by **end-users, clients, or testers** during or after development.|
|**Timing**|Conducted **throughout the development process**.|Conducted **after the product is developed or in later stages of testing**.|
|**Techniques Used**|Reviews, inspections, walkthroughs, static analysis, and unit testing.|Functional testing, system testing, acceptance testing, and user feedback.|
|**Goal**|Ensure the software **complies with design specifications** and is error-free in terms of implementation.|Ensure the software **satisfies user needs** and performs correctly in real-world scenarios.|
|**Nature**|**Static**: focuses on documentation, design, and code correctness.|**Dynamic**: focuses on running the software and observing its behavior.|
|**Outcome**|Detects **design errors, logical flaws, and coding mistakes**.|Detects **requirement mismatches, usability issues, and functional defects**.|
