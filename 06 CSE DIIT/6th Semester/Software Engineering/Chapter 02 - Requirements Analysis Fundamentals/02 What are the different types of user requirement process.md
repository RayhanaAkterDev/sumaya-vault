# Different types of user requirement process

The **requirement process** (also called the **requirements engineering process**) includes several stages that help define what a system should do. These stages help gather, analyze, document, validate, and manage requirements effectively.

> **Requirements Elicitation**: Requirements elicitation is the process of gathering information from stakeholders, such as users, clients, and other involved parties, to understand their needs and expectations from the system. This phase uses techniques like interviews, questionnaires, observations, and workshops to collect requirements. The goal is to identify what the users want the system to do.

> **Requirements Analysis**: Requirements analysis involves examining the gathered requirements to ensure they are clear, complete, consistent, and feasible. During this phase, any conflicts or ambiguities are resolved, redundant requirements are removed, and the remaining ones are prioritized based on importance and impact. This step ensures that the development team has a solid and refined foundation to work from.

> **Requirements Specification**: In the requirements specification phase, the finalized and analyzed requirements are documented in a formal and structured way. This documentation is often done in the form of a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. It includes both functional requirements, which describe what the system should do, and non-functional requirements, which describe how the system should perform.

> **Requirements Validation**: Requirements validation is the process of ensuring that the documented requirements accurately represent the stakeholdersâ€™ needs and are suitable for the intended system. This involves reviewing the requirement documents with stakeholders through walkthroughs, inspections, or prototype demonstrations to detect errors, misunderstandings, or missing information before actual development begins.

 > **Requirements Management**: Requirements management is the continuous process of monitoring, updating, and controlling changes to the requirements throughout the software development lifecycle. Since requirements may evolve due to changing business goals, user feedback, or new technical constraints, this phase ensures that all changes are tracked and handled properly without disrupting the consistency and integrity of the project.
