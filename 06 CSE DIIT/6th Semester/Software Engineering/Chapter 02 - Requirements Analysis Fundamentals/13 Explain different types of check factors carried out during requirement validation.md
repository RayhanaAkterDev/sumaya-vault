  # Different types of check factors of  requirement validation

Requirement validation ensures that the documented requirements are **correct, complete, and useful** before moving into design and development. The following check factors are commonly used:

- **Completeness**: Ensures that all necessary requirements, including functional and non-functional ones, are fully captured and documented.
    
- **Correctness**: Validates that the requirements reflect the actual needs and expectations of users or stakeholders.
    
- **Clarity / Unambiguity**: Makes sure the wording of requirements is clear and specific, leaving no room for multiple interpretations.
    
- **Consistency**: Confirms that requirements do not contradict each other and maintain a uniform approach throughout the specification.
    
- **Feasibility**: Checks whether the requirements can be realistically implemented within technical, financial, and time constraints.
    
- **Verifiability / Testability**: Ensures that each requirement can be objectively tested or evaluated during the verification process.
    
- **Traceability**: Establishes a link between each requirement and its source, allowing it to be tracked through development and changes.
    
- **Relevance**: Confirms that each requirement contributes directly to the systemâ€™s goals and is not unnecessary or out of scope.
    
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures that the requirements adhere to industry laws, standards, and government regulations.
    
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates potential risks in the requirements that could affect cost, schedule, or performance, and plans mitigation steps.
