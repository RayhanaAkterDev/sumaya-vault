# Distinction between Software Re-engineering and Reverse Engineering

Both software re-engineering and reverse engineering are techniques used to work with existing software systems, but they serve different purposes. While re-engineering focuses on improving and modifying software, reverse engineering emphasizes understanding and analyzing it.

|Aspect|Software Re-engineering|Reverse Engineering|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|It is the process of analyzing, restructuring, and improving existing software to increase maintainability and extend its useful life.|It is the process of examining an existing system to extract design details, architecture, and functionality, usually when documentation is missing.|
|**Main Purpose**|Its main aim is to enhance quality, performance, reliability, and adaptability of the system.|Its main aim is to gain understanding of how the system works.|
|**Focus**|It focuses on improvement and modernization of the system.|It focuses only on analysis and comprehension of the system.|
|**Nature of Work**|Involves both analysis of the existing system and making modifications for improvement.|Involves only analysis and documentation without changing the system.|
|**End Result**|Produces a better version of the system with improved quality or added features.|Produces knowledge, design models, or documentation of the system.|
|**Activities Involved**|Includes inventory analysis, restructuring, forward engineering, updating documentation, and testing.|Includes code analysis, control flow extraction, and design recovery.|
|**Scope**|Has a broader scope as it may also include reverse engineering as one of its steps.|Has a narrower scope limited to system understanding.|
|**Output Type**|Provides an improved, functional, and maintainable software system.|Provides diagrams, documentation, or specifications describing the system.|
|**Use Cases**|Used when old but valuable software needs to be modernized for future use.|Used when developers need to understand or document a system without sufficient records.|
|**Example**|Modernizing a hospital management system by restructuring code and updating it for a new platform.|Extracting UML diagrams from an old payroll system to recreate missing documentation.|
