# Software Re-engineering

Software re-engineering is the process of analyzing, modifying, and improving existing software to enhance its structure, performance, maintainability, or functionality without completely rewriting it. The main purpose of re-engineering is to extend the software’s useful life, reduce maintenance costs, improve reliability and efficiency, and adapt the system to new technologies or changing user requirements. By re-engineering, organizations can maintain essential business functionality while making the software easier to maintain, more compatible with modern platforms, and more cost-effective to update.

**Example:**  
A hospital management system developed five years ago may have outdated code and difficult-to-maintain modules. By performing software re-engineering, the hospital can restructure the code, update interfaces, improve performance, and ensure compatibility with new operating systems without completely rebuilding the system from scratch.
