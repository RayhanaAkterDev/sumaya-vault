# Software Maintenance  

Software maintenance is the process of systematically modifying and updating a software application after it has been delivered to the user. The purpose of maintenance is to correct defects, improve performance or functionality, and ensure the software continues to meet changing user requirements or operates correctly in a modified environment. It encompasses activities such as fixing bugs, enhancing features, adapting the software to new hardware or software platforms, and preventing potential future problems to extend the software‚Äôs useful life.
